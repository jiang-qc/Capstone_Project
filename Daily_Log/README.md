- The data is structured but umbalanced. We might need to do some preprocessing and cleaning.
- Another concern is the bias behind the data because the responses from strudents are subjective.
- When training data, the features might be corelated. To achieve a better performance, random forest models might be better than regression models.
- Jungyeul proposed to use transformer because we are dealing with text data. Neural networks might performs better.
