## 2022/05/03 Conception to Deployment + Coding Challenge Day

- We listened to the presentation from Kim about working in a startup company.


## 2022/05/04 Team Contract and EDA

- The data is structured but umbalanced. We might need to do some preprocessing and cleaning.
- Another concern is the bias behind the data because the responses from strudents are subjective.
- When training data, the features might be corelated. To achieve a better performance, random forest models might be better than regression models.
- Jungyeul proposed to use transformer because we are dealing with text data. Neural networks might performs better. 

## 2022/05/05

- I reviewed the EDA code, structured the notebook and wrote some reviews about the code.

## 2022/05/06 

- I read some papers about applying machine learning model to course evaluation.

## 2022/05/09 

- Met with Jungyeul and confirmed that we are gonna use Transformer as the baseline model.
- We need to get the baseline before May 20 and after that we will try to add some complex linguistic features.

## 2022/05/10
- I extracted the text from srt files, using regex to exclude the timestamps and special tokens

## 2022/05/11
- We met with CFI partner, presented what we have done and discussed what we should do in the following week.
- We finished the project plan.

## 2022/05/12
- Read the Long-Document Transformer paper to see how can we apply it to our model

## 2022/05/13
- I attended the Scott Mackie's talk about working in Amazon online.
- We had a meeting to discuss the what we should present on the meeting with Jungyeul.
- I used pysrt to extract the transcript and duration of each course and made them a dataframe.

## 2022/05/16
- We met with Jungyeul to discussion the two indications we've came up with, and the next step of our project.
