Whether you're in investment banking, commercial banking, private industry or investment management, you will no doubt be faced with growing interest in ESG and how it informs your or your company's decision making. The intention of this course is to prepare you with the foundational knowledge needed to respond effectively to these inquiries and leverage ESG information to conduct more effective due diligence and to make better investment decisions. In this course, we'll start getting an understanding of what ESG is, how ESG information is used to assess risk reward and management effectiveness. We'll then discuss how stakeholder expectations influence corporate action on ESG, followed by unpacking some key considerations for both corporations and investors. And finally, we will end the course by working through an exercise to assess portfolio risk and provide recommendations to management. Summit Strategy Group works with Fortune 500 companies to develop and deploy enterprise wide ESG programs and advises C suite leaders, including finance and investor relations executives on leveraging ESG as a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

ESG refers to environmental, social and governance, and the way in which these issues converge to impact a company and a company's stakeholders. Environmental criteria refers to a company's environmental stewardship, including how they manage the impacts of their operations, products and general business activity on the environment. Social criteria refers to how a company creates value for stakeholders and includes related concepts such as corporate purpose and societal impact. Governance ultimately refers to how a company is led and managed. ESG is used as a framework to assess how a company manages risks and opportunities that shifting market and non market conditions create. These shifts include changes to natural systems, social systems, economic systems, ultimately impacting the entire landscape a company operates in. Although ESG can touch upon socially conscious concepts, ESG is ultimately not about values, ESG is about the ability to create and sustain long term value in a rapidly changing marketplace economy and world and managing the risks and opportunities associated with these changes. It's important to note, there is no universal categorization for ESG issues, some issues can be categorized or defined in different ways depending on the industry, the unique characteristics of the company or the business model or the standard use to disclose information. For example, some companies and investors define diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, as a social issue to address through their hiring practices, their community engagement efforts or their procurement strategies. But some also define DEI as a governance issue, viewing a more diverse board and workforce as essential to making more informed decisions, spurring innovation and supporting the acquisition of new customers and markets. This lack of uniformity is even more reason that you as an analyst must be able to break down the issues and assess how they may impact performance and profitability. ESG is often used interchangeably with corporate social responsibility or corporate sustainability, yet ESG is a much more important thing than that. Before we dive into what ESG is though, let's look at where the concept of ESG came from. The early underpinnings of ESG came from the growing recognition that environmental and employee issues were material to a business. EHS or Environmental Health and Safety was based on the development of and the subsequent compliance with environmental and employee regulations, which evolved into the idea of corporate sustainability or a company's approach to minimizing their adverse impacts on the environment beyond what was legally required. Corporate sustainability then began to integrate ideas around how a company responds to social issues, known as corporate social responsibility. Corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism, were key tenets of CSR. Now in the 2020s, ESG has evolved into a more holistic concept associated with competitive advantage, greater management of risks and rewards. Let's now dive deeper into the ESG issues and their relevance on business today. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 195.61, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_02_What Is ESG.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 490, \"sent_count\": 21, \"avg_sentence_length\": 23.33333333333333, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 143, \"verb_count\": 75, \"nnp_count\": 28, \"nn_count\": 89, \"adverb_count\": 21, \"ner_count\": 14, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 29.99, \"gunning_fog\": 15.38, \"smog_index\": 16.3, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.5, \"avg_coherence\": 0.4481980200660856, \"word_per_second\": 2.504984407750115, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 2}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4151, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"What are the forces behind ESG becoming a mainstream business concept? The growth of ESG is due to three factors. These are materiality, the growing recognition by investors and academic researchers that ESG influences investor risk and returns. Another reason is client demand for greater transparency around how their money is invested. Lastly, regulation has played a key role, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. National and international regulators viewed the private sector as a key driver for both contributing to and addressing global public threats such as climate change and human rights violations. Some high profile examples of financial and material ESG incidents which influenced greater client demand for transparency and regulator demand for ESG to be recognized as fiduciary duty, include BP's US Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, where BP received $53.8 billion in fines, clean up costs and local reparations. In 2015, Volkswagen was charged \\u20ac27.4 billion in penalties and fines for rigging 11 million diesel vehicles to pass emissions tests, and lastly in 2018, Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal data of 87 million Facebook users resulting in Facebook losing billions in market value. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 82.95, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_03_What\\u2019s Driving Growth.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 191, \"sent_count\": 8, \"avg_sentence_length\": 23.875, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.7, \"difficult_words\": 71, \"verb_count\": 29, \"nnp_count\": 16, \"nn_count\": 33, \"adverb_count\": 2, \"ner_count\": 17, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 43.93, \"gunning_fog\": 13.9, \"smog_index\": 13.7, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 12.04, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3956203162670135, \"word_per_second\": 2.3025919228450875, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 3}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4152, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"There are several types of sustainable or socially responsible investing, and these terms can often be confusing.

Socially responsible investing, SRI is when potential investments are screened according to specific ethical guidelines. SRI screens can include issues like gambling, tobacco, weapons or fossil fuel companies. Some examples of SRI funds include Vanguard FTSE Social Index and SDRP S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserve. Impact investing. In impact investing, positive social and environmental outcomes are the key objectives, not necessarily shareholder returns. For example, the TIAA CREF Social Choice Bond holds a bond that helped a group provide vaccinations to 44 million children. Green bonds. Although closely associated with ESG and ESG centric companies tend to issue green bonds to support their efforts, a green bond is a fixed income instrument designed to specifically support projects related to climate change and environmental stewardship. A company with a mature ESG presence would be more likely to issue a green bond than a company with an immature or non existent ESG presence. ESG.

These business issues include a company's approach to reducing risk, identifying and capitalizing on market opportunities, the quality of their corporate reputation and the aspects of their intrinsic value, like culture, employee engagement, and their overall approach to human capital management. Now, let's break down each issue and examine how ESG impacts them. Corporate reputation, the way a corporation manages and communicates about ESG issues, signals to investors, customers and other stakeholders, their awareness of the risks and opportunities of changing economic, social and environmental conditions. ESG can enhance a company's License to Operate, making it easier to accomplish their business objectives and respond to crises scenarios with key stakeholder groups. Referring to the Facebook example from 2018, their billions of market losses were due to their tarnished reputation in managing cyber security attacks. Risk reduction, ESG supports identification of both immediate and long term risks depending on the industry and business model, material and labor availability, evolving regulations and supply chain disruptions are examples of potential ESG related risks. For example, a food production company in the western US is dependent on a large local labor force to produce and distribute their products. If wildfires as a result of intensifying climate change impacts damages the public transportation infrastructure that the labor force depends on to get to work this a real risk to the company's business continuity. Opportunity management, shifting market and non market conditions in addition to greater stakeholder engagement and stewardship can expose unmet needs for new products and services, unserved or underserved customer bases, and vital strategic relationships for addressing ESG issues of mutual interest or concern. For example, Unilever's ESG efforts in emerging markets have resulted in greater profitability and market penetration as well as positive societal impact by providing a wide range of training and support to independent stores, kiosks and micro businesses. In emerging markets, Unilever is accessing new customer bases and generating revenue streams through localized distribution networks that only local vendors could tap into previously. Culture and intrinsic value. A company's ESG maturity is a good indicator of their commitment to building a high performing, purpose driven workforce and inclusive culture. Since intrinsic value is a forward looking measure of company worth based on a company's strategies and its ability to execute them, a more engaged workforce is crucial. In a nutshell, integrating ESG factors into evaluation allows for greater insight into intangible factors like culture, talent recruitment and retention, operational excellence and risk that can improve investment outcomes. For example, a company with an authoritative leadership philosophy and hierarchical culture may dissuade entry level employees from speaking up if they see and hear something a potential risk or opportunity. A company with an inclusive culture and systems for expressing concern, sharing insights could avoid a risk or capitalize on a unique opportunity by systematically encouraging open dialogue and communication at every level of the organization. The collective impacts of ESG on the standard business issues leads to outcomes essential to the long term viability of the firm and the risk and reward ratios of a given fund. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 235.46, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_05_Why Is It Important.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 556, \"sent_count\": 20, \"avg_sentence_length\": 27.8, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 202, \"verb_count\": 73, \"nnp_count\": 22, \"nn_count\": 138, \"adverb_count\": 7, \"ner_count\": 10, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 16.86, \"gunning_fog\": 19.11, \"smog_index\": 18.2, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 11.0, \"avg_coherence\": 0.379025732477506, \"word_per_second\": 2.361335258642657, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 5}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4154, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"Chapter Two, ESG factors. Now that we have a big picture idea of how ESG supports a company's risk management and business continuity capabilities, let's dive into the issues themselves. We'll be going through key environmental, social, and governance issues that have a material impact on the widest spectrum of industries. First, let's dive into the most prominent environmental issues to be aware of, although not exhaustive as environmental issues include a wide range of concepts like deforestation, biodiversity health, climate change, natural resource scarcity, and all pollution and waste are financially material to a wide range of industries. In turn, significant issues to be aware of from a perspective making capital allocation decisions. Let's unpack these a bit. Climate change. Climate change is the ultimate risk accelerant exacerbating both conventional and ESG related risks, rising temperatures, more frequent and intense weather events, including storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires, all significant risks across industries in the economy. If you are a financial analyst for a REIT, for example, climate change presents a portfolio risk to all commercial real estate and risk assessment should account for how climate change may impact the asset itself, as well as the associated insurance and maintenance costs. Natural resource scarcity. Due to changing environmental conditions, the stewardship of scarce natural resources like water and soil are increasingly important to more industries and vital to the welfare of all stakeholder groups. If you're an analyst conducting due diligence on a multi national food company, it's their approach to managing the risks associated with depleting global water supplies and increasing drought, that would be a direct material risk to account for. Pollution and waste. Pollution and waste can have far reaching risks on companies and portfolios. Pollution and waste can cause serious repetitional and reputational risk to a business, like plastic waste or food waste, and can influence product R&D, retail expectations, and consumer requirements. Additionally, pollution can cause health concerns that influence license to operate and can trigger serious legal and regulatory ramifications. For example, beaches littered with plastic waste from the bottled beverage industry will influence local tourism, Travel and Leisure industries due to the reduced appeal of these destinations. Analysts responsible for making capital allocation decisions should absolutely be monitoring a company's management of pollution and waste. Environmental issues may not impact the company or portfolio directly, but it will most definitely have a material impact on key stakeholders like customers, consumers, or suppliers. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 167.45, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_06_Environmental Factors.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 419, \"sent_count\": 20, \"avg_sentence_length\": 20.95, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 129, \"verb_count\": 45, \"nnp_count\": 20, \"nn_count\": 108, \"adverb_count\": 13, \"ner_count\": 2, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 31.41, \"gunning_fog\": 15.75, \"smog_index\": 16.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.97, \"avg_coherence\": 0.4458884046309524, \"word_per_second\": 2.502239474469991, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 6}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4155, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"We know that certain industries will have greater risk exposure to environmental issues than others. But as a financial analyst, the single most important environmental issue you need to be aware of, is climate change. Climate change presents a wide range of direct and indirect risks to companies. The easiest way to think about them, is in terms of three types of risks, physical, transition, and human risk. Physical risks. Physical risks are exactly what they sound like. Climate change can physically impact company assets and surrounding infrastructure, and the assets and infrastructure of key stakeholders like customers and suppliers. These changes will also influence supply and demand, as resource needs change amidst these conditions. Think about coastal communities, how rising tides and flooding will impact local distribution infrastructure and real estate values. Transition risks. Transition risks are a bit more abstract than physical risks, they include shifts in climate and environmental policy, associated technologies and changing consumer preferences. For example, a multi national invests in a brand new fleet of diesel trucks, without following evolving federal legislation and local legislation in key markets. When carbon taxes are passed in key markets, these assets could now be considered some cost and/or liabilities. Human risks, severe weather, rising temperatures, natural resource scarcity, all will result in certain regions being unlivable. Mass migration due to the adverse living conditions could risk the viability of certain geographic markets, local labor force availability and required infrastructure. Although described separately, the reality is these risks are often interconnected and can exacerbate the impacts of one another. Take the coastal community example. If local infrastructure is damaged by the physical impacts of climate change, local labor forces may be forced to migrate inland, due to the economic and human health risks associated with the damage. Local businesses that rely on this local labor force will suffer due to the human resource challenges. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 127.62, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_07_Impact of Environmental Factors on Corporations.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 317, \"sent_count\": 19, \"avg_sentence_length\": 16.68421052631579, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 101, \"verb_count\": 51, \"nnp_count\": 9, \"nn_count\": 64, \"adverb_count\": 8, \"ner_count\": 1, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 35.68, \"gunning_fog\": 13.01, \"smog_index\": 14.2, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.91, \"avg_coherence\": 0.4405509619151844, \"word_per_second\": 2.4839366870396486, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 7}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4156, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"Let's look at social factors.

The following issues represent significant risks to a wide range of industries, and that's why we've chosen to focus on them specifically. There are also increasing calls for greater disclosure in these spaces by regulatory bodies. Let's examine the risks associated these factors. Human Capital Management and welfare, shortages of skilled labor, uneven wage growth, technology and evolving market trends are transforming the talent market, making human capital management a key issue. The world's largest investors like BlackRock are demanding more comprehensive disclosures on how companies are building the skills, knowledge and collective capacity of their workforce to improve bottom line outcomes. This issue will be specifically relevant to less labor intensive industries, like Hi Tech, Finance, and Consulting. In August 2020, the SEC deemed human capital management as a significant material risk and greater disclosure requirements will soon be a part of standard financial reporting. Product and service safety. Product safety and supply chain oversight is a significant risk to corporate reputation, customer retention and reparation costs not to mention, regulatory fines. The direct cost for food, product safety recalls for example, is estimated to be approximately $10 million per recall. Human rights and labor management. Investor interest in human rights and labor management has grown in recent years due to some high profile human rights abuses in brand name company supply chains. When Nike was accused in the 1990s of knowingly using forced labor in Asia to produce their products, this controversy led to significant college athletic team boycotts, institutional customer losses and a wide range of consumer protests, all damaging corporate reputation and the bottom line. Labor protests are also a growing material issue due to risks it poses to business continuity. Whether domestically or abroad, the way in which a company manages its relationship with labor is important to assess when gauging a company, industry or specific funds risk exposure. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 140.63, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_08_Social Factors.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 341, \"sent_count\": 17, \"avg_sentence_length\": 20.058823529411764, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.7, \"difficult_words\": 115, \"verb_count\": 49, \"nnp_count\": 19, \"nn_count\": 81, \"adverb_count\": 10, \"ner_count\": 10, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 34.46, \"gunning_fog\": 13.87, \"smog_index\": 14.9, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 10.59, \"avg_coherence\": 0.356090410798788, \"word_per_second\": 2.4248026736827137, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 8}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4157, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"Let's break down the risks and opportunities these social factors can create for a given company. Employees. A mature ESG presence has a direct impact on employee recruitment, engagement and retention, in addition to greater productivity and performance, all positively influencing the bottom line. A lack of attention to employee investment, engagement, and general welfare can result in significant losses. Annual research from Gallup, consistently points to employee engagement's direct impact on corporate profitability and economic stability. Research shows engaged employees result in 21% greater profitability, disengaged employees cost companies between 450 and 550 billion dollars annually due to absenteeism, burnout, negative health consequences. Customers. Conventional customer preferences, including convenience and price are shifting to include concepts like environmental sustainability, social impact and customer experience. A company's ESG maturity can signal to you as an analyst, that they are deeply engaged with their customers' evolving needs and unique pressures. Using the Nike labor scandal example, athletic institutional customers were pressured by their constituents to cut business ties with Nike, resulting in revenue loss and loss of key advertising opportunities. On the flip side, using the Unilever example, they were able to access unserved customer bases by supporting the welfare of local shopkeepers selling Unilever products. Communities. The welfare of the communities that grow necessary materials, house assets and production sites and supply labor are all inextricably linked to the welfare of company interests. Improved relationships with local communities, also enhance the company's license to operate. As an analyst, the financial and in kind contributions to community causes and the extent of their engagement on community issues can provide insight into how corporations will manage the ESG issues that threaten both the company and the local community. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 127.43, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_09_Impact of Social Factors on Corporations.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 290, \"sent_count\": 15, \"avg_sentence_length\": 19.33333333333333, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.9, \"difficult_words\": 107, \"verb_count\": 42, \"nnp_count\": 17, \"nn_count\": 71, \"adverb_count\": 7, \"ner_count\": 9, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 21.94, \"gunning_fog\": 17.21, \"smog_index\": 17.4, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 11.39, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3211740003182338, \"word_per_second\": 2.27575924036726, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 9}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4158, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"Governance, or the G in ESG, covers a wide range of issues that can also be considered environmental or social concerns, depending on how a company investor or entity categorizes it. For example, supply chain management touches upon environmental and social issues, yet the management of a supply chain is ultimately dictated by those in positions of senior leadership. Let's go through some of the more dominant governance issues you should be aware of, board quality, diversity and effectiveness. The qualifications, accountability measures, and overall approach to counseling management to execute on multi year strategies, including the integration of ESG factors into risk management and business planning are key governance concepts. As large enterprises serve diverse markets, board diversity supports the successful engagement of diverse customer basis. For example, as companies enter emerging markets, a homogenous board of directors will most likely engage in group think, reducing innovation and the ability to comprehend the needs and opportunities within diverse customer bases. Investors are increasingly looking at DEI as a critical benchmark and are looking for more comprehensive execution of DEI strategies. Reporting transparency, business ethics. The comprehensiveness, the accuracy and the consistency of ESG reporting disclosures are essential to both investor confidence and valuations in addition to consumer and stakeholder trust. Heightened public scrutiny in corporate supply chains and social media have made transparency the new normal for both consumer facing and B2B businesses as consumers increasingly desire information on product sourcing, production and labor, a company withholding this information will lose these customers. Investors will also make consequential assumptions about a company's management quality and intrinsic value when limited product or company information is publicly available. As an analyst, the extent of their disclosures and reporting should indicate the extent of their thinking around these issues. The leading and most credible disclosure frameworks include the industry specific standards from their Sustainable Accounting Standards Board, SASB and the cross industry recommendations laid out by the Task force for Carbon related Financial Disclosures, TCFD. The Global Reporting Initiative or GRI is another globally recognized and used framework for disclosing progress on these G issues and complement SASB and TCFD. Executive compensation, long termism and ESG integration. As an analyst, if you see an executive compensation structure tied to environmental and social benchmarks and an ESG Committee at the Board level, you can be sure they are fully integrating these issues into their enterprise risk management system and long term planning. ESG integration or the process of systematically integrating ESG issues into daily business operations is the single most important insight to deliver as a financial analyst.

Enhanced governance directly impacts the trust necessary for stakeholder confidence and license to operate. Back to that Nike controversy. Their lack of accountability and due diligence regarding who they contract with led to institutional customer losses, consumer boycotts and significant investor concerns about their license to operate both domestically and abroad. Enhanced Risk Management. ESG integration provides greater sensitivity to changing market and non market conditions that could negatively impact business continuity, including stakeholder opposition, boycotts or government fines and litigation. Long term value creation. Integrating ESG factors into enterprise risk management and corporate strategy supports the organizational adaptability and resilience required to adjust to shifting economic, environmental and social conditions. This supports identifying opportunities for long term value creation by identifying new markets, customers and unmet needs.

A materiality analysis is the process of identifying the ESG issues most impactful to a company's business success and most important to its stakeholders. Understanding a materiality analysis enables you to get a glimpse into their perspective on high priority concerns and the risk that they consider to be most material to business success. As an analyst, the stakeholder aspect provides you with an idea as to where opposition may lie and the extent of material risk associated with these opposing stakeholder interests. If a company hasn't undergone a materiality analysis, it's safe to say their approach to ESG is less mature and they don't have a holistic understanding of the relevant ESG priorities they should address. There's no uniform approach to a materiality analysis outside of the content for the two axes, impact on business success and importance to stakeholders. As a financial analyst, you can use the materiality assessment to get an idea of where a company sees its greatest risks to the business and the welfare of its key stakeholders, and you can leverage the analysis as a tool for measuring the efficacy and maturity of the company's work on ESG in general. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 91.98, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_12_Materiality.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 249, \"sent_count\": 9, \"avg_sentence_length\": 27.666666666666668, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.7, \"difficult_words\": 58, \"verb_count\": 33, \"nnp_count\": 7, \"nn_count\": 64, \"adverb_count\": 5, \"ner_count\": 2, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 24.0, \"gunning_fog\": 17.68, \"smog_index\": 18.6, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.0, \"avg_coherence\": 0.538473156946046, \"word_per_second\": 2.7071102413568164, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 12}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4161, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"We've gone through some very specific examples of how an environmental, social and governance issue can inform potential risks and opportunities. Now, let's explore what happens when multiple environmental, social and governance issues across categories converge in real time. Although ESG issues are neatly packaged into three separate categories, the reality is that they often converge to create novel risks that reverberate across supply chains, interdependent industries and entire communities. As social and environmental issues collide, the quality of governance is the determining factor in treating change in market and non market context as both risks and opportunities. In addition to novel risk, comprehension and identification of material ESG issues can unearth unmet customer bases and markets, product innovation and new business models adapted to these changes in market and non market factors. For example, a food service company who relies heavily on animal protein revenues could see their raw material input costs increase due to water scarcity and rising costs and rising temperatures could require increased expenditures for their manufacturing plant refrigeration systems. These issues are risks to their key revenue streams, but also present unique opportunities as consumer preferences for plant based proteins continue to grow exponentially, this food service company could capitalize on this trend by integrating plant based proteins into their key offerings. Not only does this capture an emerging customer base and capitalize on a consumer preference change, but it also reduces the amount of water required for production and reduces the amount of refrigeration and associated power needed to store these products. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 107.68, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_13_ESG Risks _ Opportunities.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 260, \"sent_count\": 8, \"avg_sentence_length\": 32.5, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 89, \"verb_count\": 40, \"nnp_count\": 4, \"nn_count\": 62, \"adverb_count\": 8, \"ner_count\": 1, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 21.77, \"gunning_fog\": 18.35, \"smog_index\": 17.3, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 10.75, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3898314163088798, \"word_per_second\": 2.414561664190193, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 13}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4162, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"Chapter three, corporate pressures and stakeholder expectations.

As an analyst, combing through ESG disclosures, you'll often see references to stakeholder value creation and stakeholder capitalism. These are important concepts, they should have a bearing on capital allocation decisions. First, you need to understand what a stakeholder is. A stakeholder is essentially any individual or entity, who's affected by or can affect the business. Stakeholder groups can be both internal and external to a company, including owners, employees, customers, supply chain partners, investors, local communities, government and NGOs, and civil society. As you can imagine, the quality of these relationships can often dictate the company's ability to anticipate and manage risks and opportunities. Effective stakeholder management can also support a company's crisis response and business continuity planning. The interdependence and interconnectedness of stakeholder welfare and corporate profitability demonstrates that ESG is just good business. If you're assessing a company's risk exposure and there's no mention of their approach to stakeholder management, you can assume that it's a risk to the business in and of itself. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 88.77, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_14_Stakeholders.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 226, \"sent_count\": 13, \"avg_sentence_length\": 17.384615384615383, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.7, \"difficult_words\": 71, \"verb_count\": 32, \"nnp_count\": 7, \"nn_count\": 61, \"adverb_count\": 7, \"ner_count\": 3, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 34.56, \"gunning_fog\": 14.15, \"smog_index\": 15.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.71, \"avg_coherence\": 0.4761296199126677, \"word_per_second\": 2.545905148135632, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 14}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4163, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"Let's spend some time on the stakeholder groups and the material implications for how a company responds to them. Investors, the world's largest institutional investors have publicly declared ESG criteria will guide their decision making on investment decisions. This is particularly true with regards to climate related risk, investors are holding companies accountable for progress on ESG issues, enhanced disclosure and reporting and the integration of ESG risk and opportunity management into their corporate strategies, fundamentally, investors are expecting greater clarity, greater accountability measures for ESG efforts and their intended outcomes. In 2020, the world's largest institutional investor, BlackRock publicly announced that ESG issues will be guiding all their decision making moving forward, prompting the investment community to follow suit. Customers and supply chain partners, businesses that are B2B or sell to other businesses are expected to contribute to customers' ESG goals, since supply chains are now considered a part of the company's footprint and respective impacts. Now supply chain partner ESG maturity is key to both customer acquisition for the supplier and corporate risk management. In consumer facing businesses, B2C traditional drivers like price and convenience are stable but evolving drivers, including company transparency, labor relations, product safety and the environmental and social impacts of corporate behavior and their supply chain partners are becoming equally important consumer decision making drivers. Employees, employee engagement has a positive correlation with a company's ESG maturity. In the talent wars of today's labor market, companies that serve a higher purpose than just generating profit attract and retain better talent. This will only become increasingly important as millennials are the largest, most educated and most diverse demographic group in the workforce, and they've been responsible for influencing societal norms around key ESG issues. Gen Z, the youngest group in the workforce have been engaged in these types of issues throughout their childhoods and expect their employers to share these values as they enter their professional careers. Communities and civil society, local leaders expect direct engagement on local economic, environmental and social issues over corporate philanthropy, throwing money at problems while continuing to operate in ways that create the problems in the first place is a key criticism of philanthropy driven CSR or corporate social responsibility. Companies are expected to engage in local issues that impact the community instead of sponsoring local little leagues or similar efforts peripheral to the real material risks of the business, issues such as local workforce development and employment or community partnerships on reducing carbon emissions are examples of modern expectations. As an analyst, the way in which a company responds to these expectations is for you a good indicator of how they're managing risks in the short term and planning for potential risks on the horizon. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 188.06, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_15_Stakeholder Expectations.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 465, \"sent_count\": 15, \"avg_sentence_length\": 31.0, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 156, \"verb_count\": 69, \"nnp_count\": 19, \"nn_count\": 105, \"adverb_count\": 13, \"ner_count\": 6, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 21.47, \"gunning_fog\": 19.69, \"smog_index\": 18.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 10.61, \"avg_coherence\": 0.4241964404399578, \"word_per_second\": 2.472615122833138, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 15}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4164, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"Supply Chain Management deserves some special attention due to the unique risks it presents in today's landscape.

For example, negative supply chain events that once occurred on the other side of the world are now front and center due to social media and greater stakeholder awareness of these issues.

Now that we have an idea of modern stakeholder expectations and how they impact a company's approach to ESG and risk management, let's look at some key considerations that you should be aware of from both the company and the investor perspective. The completeness and transparency of ESG reporting can have a direct impact on valuations, shareholder voting, RFP decision making and other decisions key to securing capital and ongoing support. All stakeholders, including investors and creditors, rely on publicly available information to determine the effectiveness and maturity of a company's ESG strategy. As you can imagine, a company with limited publicly available information runs the risk of its most important stakeholders making assumptions about what they are and are not doing, and what risks they are and are not aware of and planning for. To figure this all out, an analyst should look for a company's ESG disclosures and associated reports, ESG info on the web page, and ultimately, look for reporting on material issues relevant to the industry, whether it be on a third party reporting initiative platform like the Carbon Disclosure Project or integrated into their annual 10K report. An investor should also look at ratings and ranking agencies and key indices, such as MSCI, JUST Capital and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index to glean insights on ESG performance. It's important to know, ratings and ranking agencies also rely on publicly available information to assign a rating or inclusion in ESG lists and induces. The way a company discloses and communicates their ESG Management, strategy, progress and outcomes directly impacts how external stakeholders perceive their ESG maturity, their corporate culture and their ability to create long term value. As the analyst, you can provide significant value through your ability to identify thematic consistencies in how a company shows up in ratings indices and ESG reports. It's important to note that every entity, every research firm and rating list uses a different set of criteria and verification processes to inform their determination of a company's ESG performance. This is another reason why as a financial analyst, you need to understand the details and nuances of the company, their approach to ESG and how they're disclosing their efforts. You'll also need to be familiar with these rating agencies and indices as they're important tools you can use to help you do your job. As you can see here, there is significant variance in the way four different entities gauge a single company's ESG maturity and performance, therefore these ratings should not be taken as a sole source of input in evaluating ESG performance. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 175.44, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_17_Reporting, Transparency, and Valuation.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 453, \"sent_count\": 14, \"avg_sentence_length\": 32.357142857142854, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.6, \"difficult_words\": 118, \"verb_count\": 66, \"nnp_count\": 32, \"nn_count\": 85, \"adverb_count\": 13, \"ner_count\": 11, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 30.94, \"gunning_fog\": 18.07, \"smog_index\": 18.2, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.56, \"avg_coherence\": 0.5545124014218649, \"word_per_second\": 2.582079343365253, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 17}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4166, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"Corporations do not exist in a vacuum, and global economy and global supply chain means ESG impacts can negatively or positively influence all parties along the value chain or in a business ecosystem due to their interconnectedness and their interdependence. We touched upon some of these issues at the beginning of the course, but now we'll take a deeper dive to remind everyone, ESG ultimately provides a competitive advantage in the following five ways, one, reducing risk, two increasing opportunities and growth, three enhancing organizational resiliency, four boosting workforce productivity, and finally, cementing corporate reputation and stakeholder trust. Let's look at some specific examples of what this could look like. Here's an example for each of the sources of competitive advantage that demonstrate the difference between a strong ESG strategy and a weak one. Reduced risk. Two local food production companies rely on consistent shipments of crops, seeds and materials to operate, recent storms have flooded the distribution routes that a large wholesaler uses to reach these two companies. The company with a weaker ESG strategy cannot access the material inputs required to produce their products creating an immediate disruption to basic operations, the company with a stronger ESG strategy has actively cultivated relationships with local small scale farmers to hedge against climate change impacts and is able to access their key material inputs from local producers and in turn able to continue operating without any disruptions. Opportunities and growth. Take the same two food production companies, one company decides that the additional costs and complexity of going through Kosher and Halal certification for their products is not worth the resources or effort the other company thinks it's an opportunity. The company with a stronger ESG strategy has identified that they compete with their local peer in markets with large Jewish and Muslim populations, now this company has captured these customer bases and the institutional customers that serve these populations, the company with the weaker ESG strategy, saved some resources upfront, but ultimately lost potential customers and the opportunities associated with these customers in the long run. Organizational resiliency. Two competing North American hotel corporations, were operating in a coastal tourist destination in South East Asia, local community members had been holding recent rallies calling for greater government oversight on plastic waste from companies operating in the region. The company with the stronger ESG strategy believed they could be a target for the stakeholder opposition and began procuring recyclable and biodegradable alternatives from domestic suppliers, promoting more on site dining and opening up a dialogue with the community, although more expensive at the outset, this company anticipated the necessary change and adapted, the company with the weaker ESG strategy, became the next target of community protests and ultimately suffered losses from these disruptions to daily operations. Workforce productivity. Two competing companies with different corporate cultures, one company has a competitive culture that emphasizes winning at all costs. The other company has a culture that emphasizes collaboration, inclusive dialogue, and candor, the company with the competitive culture has higher attrition rates, higher associated healthcare costs due to burn out from this competitive approach, while the other has lower attrition rates and a healthier workforce with lower associated health care costs, which do you think is the company with a strong ESG strategy? You guessed it, the one that focuses on the cultural impacts of workforce productivity, finally reputation and stakeholder trust. Two companies are suffering severe human resource constraints, one company with a weaker ESG strategy has minimal relations with the local community and other stakeholder groups and continues to post and prey openings on online job boards to fill vacancies. They're currently operating at 60% capacity. The company with the stronger ESG strategy has been tuned into affairs of the local community and some of the local community challenges, one being workforce development, this company engages the local municipality and three community colleges, eventually receiving a grant to develop a job training certification program in conjunction with the three community colleges. Now a local and sustainable talent pipeline has been developed that both alleviates the long standing human resource constraints of the strong ESG company while maximizing local resources and solving a local stakeholder issue. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.12771890686001, \"Duration\": 277.958, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Introduction to ESG/IntroESG_18_ESG _ Competitive Advantage.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 21, \"word_count\": 710, \"sent_count\": 22, \"avg_sentence_length\": 32.27272727272727, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 192, \"verb_count\": 113, \"nnp_count\": 24, \"nn_count\": 146, \"adverb_count\": 17, \"ner_count\": 25, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 14.77, \"gunning_fog\": 20.79, \"smog_index\": 20.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 10.17, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2590469550341367, \"word_per_second\": 2.554342742428712, \"NPS_score\": 70.39598438371445, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 1, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 0.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 1, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 0.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 18}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4167, \"CourseName\": \"Introduction to ESG\", \"Transcript\": \"As you can see, ESG can impact many aspects of a business, both internally and externally.

Although climate has been deemed the existential crisis of our time, and in turn an existential crisis to corporations, social and governance issues, such as employee welfare and Diversity, Equity Inclusion and Social Justice, all are increasingly becoming material. For example, South Africa's biggest retailers stopped selling an American hair product brand due to perceptions of racist marketing and advertising. Transparency and disclosure. Stakeholders across the board, ranging from investors to consumers are demanding greater transparency and disclosure on product labeling, operations, sourcing, employee demographics and etcetera. Analysts are specifically looking for greater detail on the company's ESG strategy, oversight protocols, the quality of their data and their KPIs and associated metrics. Long term ownership mindset. Investors are looking for management quality indicators beyond quarterly returns and stock prices. Investors are expecting compensation structures to be tied to longer time horizons that allow ESG efforts to bear fruit, reducing the likelihood of questionable corporate behavior to spike quarterly numbers. Fund performance. ESG funds outperform the markets and conventional indices during the COVID 19 pandemic in 2020, a historic human health and economic catastrophe whose impacts mirror that of the Great Recession.

The We Mean Business Coalition is catalyzing business action and driving policy ambition to accelerate the zero carbon transition. Corporate initiatives. RE100 is a global initiative, bringing together the world's most influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. The United Nations Global Compact is a voluntary initiative based on CEO commitments to implement universal sustainability principles and to undertake partnerships in support of UN goals, and the sustainable purchasing leadership council convenes buyers, suppliers, and public interest advocates to develop programs that simplify and standardize sustainable purchasing efforts by larger organizations.

The impacts of these initiatives have led to both investors asking for more content and disclosure on in corporations to further develop the following, corporate purpose.

Detailed disclosure on navigating physical transition and market labor risks are becoming boardroom priorities. Translating societal risks to business opportunities.

Welcome to CFI's course on writing and interpreting ESG disclosures. Corporate ESG performance is rapidly becoming a key indicator of a company's ability to compete in a changing business landscape and a global society. It is essential to understand and assess how ESG information creates risk and opportunity for an industry, a company, or a potential investment. As a financial analyst, it is critical to understand the fundamentals of interpreting ESG and the mechanics of presenting ESG performance. In this course, we will explain the key concepts behind ESG disclosure before we define quantitative and qualitative disclosures to better understand the use cases, objectives, and impacts of different types of disclosure methods. Then we'll prepare and position ESG disclosure to meet a variety of expectations and requirements from investors, policymakers, customers, and rating agencies. Next, we'll work through how to interpret ESG disclosure and analyze disclosure quality to understand how stakeholders evaluate ESG risk and opportunity. And finally, we'll compare two companies' ESG disclosures using real publicly available information. Throughout this course you'll be watching video lectures, participating in interactive exercises, and applying your knowledge in a case study. This writing and interpreting ESG disclosures course is part of CFI's ESG Specialist Training Program.

Disclosure generally focuses on three areas: Environmental sustainability, societal impact, and corporate governance. Environmental sustainability includes topics related to the externalities, utilization, and remediation of the environmental resources and quality. Societal impact reporting often covers company action on ensuring the wellbeing of its internal and external stakeholders. Topics like community engagement, human capital development and management, employee welfare, and occupational health and safety generally fall under this category. Lastly, reporting on corporate governance shows a company's board oversight, risk management, and stakeholder engagement tactics towards addressing ESG risks and opportunities across its own operation and supply chain. The objective of ESG disclosure is to allow internal and external stakeholders to be informed about a company's integration and management of ESG risks and opportunities. Stakeholders, especially investors, are expecting companies to demonstrate robust corporate ESG strategies to support business resilience, growth, risk mitigation, and long term value creation opportunities.

ESG disclosures enhance information symmetry between the company and external stakeholders. Improved information symmetry helps buy side participants like asset and fund managers mitigate extreme loss due to a risk that may have not been captured appropriately through limited public data. For sell side players, increasing ESG reporting could create a competitive advantage by tapping into growing customer base of firms that are increasingly interested in ESG factors. Risk management reporting in ESG disclosures enable internal and external stakeholders to better understand the likelihood, intensity and impact of future risks that create substantial threats to a business. ESG disclosures can also bring stakeholder value by more clearly presenting how products and services bring positive impact to society. Reporting ESG strategy and performance increases the transparency around strengths and potential impacts to society, which could create market penetration and customer acquisition opportunities, increase company value and ultimately, stock prices. The enhanced reporting also helps corporations capture opportunities to improve upon sustainability performance for internal and external stakeholders, the environment and society. As the world is moving towards a low carbon and sustainable economy, ESG reporting serves as evidence of a company's action toward adapting to a net zero world and creating accountability around their responsibilities in addressing negative impacts generated by their businesses. Due to globalization, companies need to increase visibility and innovation to operate in a competitive international market. ESG disclosure not only helps a company maintain its reputation in corporate social responsibility, but it also enables a corporation to demonstrate its strategies and oversight around ESG risks and opportunities. Today, ESG disclosures are a table stake and an essential part in separating industry leaders from the rest of the pack. Lastly, ESG disclosures that substantiate the sustainability and ethical claims of service offerings is critical to retain consumer trust and brand loyalty.

It should be standardized, consumable, transparent, timely, and accurate. Disclosures should be standardized in a way that allow benchmarking with other companies in a given industry. Using widely accepted frameworks allows stakeholders to easily compare a company's performance against its competitors. Data must also be consumable, which means companies should only include information that would be useful for decision making. Consumable disclosure is financially material, comparable, reliable and consistent. Determining what is material is the first step in effective disclosure. Disclosing only topics and metrics that are financially material can reduce the complexity in analyzing data for your stakeholders. Data should also be comparable, meaning using a set of standard units and metrics to allow researchers to normalize and benchmark. Data should be reliable, assuring stakeholders that it is complete and free of errors or biases. More and more companies are seeking third party audits and/or assurance to substantiate the accuracy and credibility of their ESG data. Lastly, sustainability reporting should be consistent over time, meaning that stakeholders can expect to see similar topics and metrics reported in similar ways year over year enabling better performance evaluation. Transparency is also key to strong ESG disclosure. Any data gaps, notable exclusions, or omissions should be clear and apparent so that a reader can understand the full context of the report. The methodology, scope of data coverage, and process for determining reporting content should be articulated clearly. ESG disclosure should be timely, regular, and recurring. Information should be reported on a quarterly or annual basis and reflect the most updated information that a company has regarding its impacts. Lastly, ESG disclosures should be accurate and they should limit areas of ambiguity.

And ESG performance aims to illustrate existing efforts and progress towards committing to and achieving the sustainability goals of a company. \", \"Response_Q1\": 8.786666666666667, \"Duration\": 55.81, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/ESG Disclosure/ESGDisc_07_ESG Reporting Attributes.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 25, \"word_count\": 101, \"sent_count\": 5, \"avg_sentence_length\": 20.2, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 2.0, \"difficult_words\": 41, \"verb_count\": 14, \"nnp_count\": 4, \"nn_count\": 29, \"adverb_count\": 1, \"ner_count\": 1, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 17.13, \"gunning_fog\": 16.79, \"smog_index\": 17.1, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 11.83, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3734749307235082, \"word_per_second\": 1.809711521232754, \"NPS_score\": 54.66666666666666, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 2, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 2, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 7}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1309, \"CourseName\": \"ESG Disclosure\", \"Transcript\": \"Some common reporting frameworks include the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB, the Global Reporting Initiative, the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures or TCFD, the Integrated Reporting Framework, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the Principles For Responsible Investment. Many of these frameworks are complementary and companies may choose to use multiple frameworks depending on their different stakeholder audiences. Here, we will introduce investor facing and public facing reporting frameworks. Investor facing frameworks include SASB, TCFD, IR and PRI. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB is a reporting framework focused on industry specific ESG issues. SASB has developed over 75 industry reporting standards that cover quantitative and qualitative metrics that capture financially material sustainability topics. SASB standards include material issues across five dimensions: Environment, social capital, human capital, business model and innovation, and leadership and governance. Investors are increasingly demanding SASB disclosure from companies to capture financially related sustainability data to inform their investment decisions in a standardized and comparable way. The Task Force on Climate Related Financial disclosures or TCFD provides recommendations on voluntary climate change disclosures that aim to increase and improve reporting of climate related financial information in capital markets. The reporting guidelines provide benefits in advancing risk assessment, capital allocation, and strategic planning to tackle climate challenges. The recommendations are structured around four areas including governance, strategy, risk management, as well as metrics and targets relating to climate risks and opportunities. TCFD is increasingly mandated by governments and the investment community. The CEO of BlackRock, one of the largest institutional asset management firms, encourages their portfolio companies to work towards TCFD aligned reporting. On the regulatory side, the United Kingdom government plans to make TCFD reporting mandatory across the UK economy by 2025. Needless to say, TCFD reporting has become table stakes for companies aiming to demonstrate ESG strategies and climate commitments. The International Integrated Reporting Framework or IR is a disclosure guideline developed by the International Integrated Reporting Council or the IIRC. The framework is used to accelerate the adoption of integrated reporting across the world. The IR framework aims to improve the quality of financial information and enhance accountability to enable a more efficient and productive allocation of capital. In 2021, IIRC and SASB announced their intention to merge and form the Value Reporting Foundation with the aim of offering investors and companies a comprehensive corporate reporting framework to drive global sustainability performance. Other integrated reporting guidelines on financially material topics are expected to come to fruition in the future as well. The Principles For Responsible Investment is the United Nations supported international network of investors working to promote sustainable investment through the incorporation of ESG factors. The signatories of PRI are mainly investment managers, asset owners and research and shareholder engagement service providers. They are required to commit to following six principles of incorporating and disclosing ESG issues into investment analysis, ownership policies and engagement within the investment industry. PRI signatories are also required to publicly report on their responsible investment activities every year. In 2020, the collective assets under management represented by PRI signatories reached $110 trillion representing over 3900 signatories. \", \"Response_Q1\": 8.786666666666667, \"Duration\": 282.58, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/ESG Disclosure/ESGDisc_08_Investor-Facing ESG Reporting Frameworks.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 25, \"word_count\": 523, \"sent_count\": 25, \"avg_sentence_length\": 20.92, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 2.0, \"difficult_words\": 178, \"verb_count\": 82, \"nnp_count\": 82, \"nn_count\": 98, \"adverb_count\": 11, \"ner_count\": 33, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 16.42, \"gunning_fog\": 14.94, \"smog_index\": 17.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.93, \"avg_coherence\": 0.4734848886728287, \"word_per_second\": 1.8508033123363297, \"NPS_score\": 54.66666666666666, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 2, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 2, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 8}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1310, \"CourseName\": \"ESG Disclosure\", \"Transcript\": \"Public facing frameworks include GRI, IR and the UN SDGs.

The topic specific standards consist of economic, environmental and social disclosures. Companies determine which topic specific standards are relevant to their business through a materiality assessment. A materiality assessment is an evaluation process that involves relevant stakeholders to determine issue areas that may pose substantial impact to a company's financial performance, operations and reputations. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals consist of 17 overarching goals and 169 targets in improving health and education, reducing social inequality, spurring economic growth, all while tackling climate change and working to preserve natural resources by 2030.

Companies are now required to provide stakeholder insight into human capital management from the operating model to talent planning, learning and innovation, employee experience and work environment. In the environmental category, the US Administration is considering strengthening climate related disclosures. The SEC has created a climate and ESG task force and started reviewing the 2010 SEC climate related disclosure guidance provided to public companies. Though not yet officially mandated, climate related disclosures are already considered by many large industry players in the capital markets. In Europe, the EU and the UK have published ESG disclosure requirements for market participants, including public companies, investment firms and fund managers. The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Requirements, or SFDR, came into force in March of 2021. The SFDR introduces disclosure obligations for asset managers to report ESG integration, the adverse impact of investments and environmental and social characteristics at both product and firm level. The UK has announced that climate related and TCFD aligned disclosure requirements are expected to apply to all listed issuers and large asset owners by 2022. In addition, the UK government intends to introduce fully mandatory climate related financial disclosure requirements across the UK economy by 2025. Both disclosure requirements show the importance and urgency for companies to take action on climate disclosures. In Asia Pacific, several regional stock exchanges have mandated ESG disclosure requirements or provided reporting guidelines. The stock exchanges of countries in East, Southeast and South Asia have announced ESG disclosure requirements for listed companies. \", \"Response_Q1\": 8.786666666666667, \"Duration\": 155.99, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/ESG Disclosure/ESGDisc_10_Emerging Trends.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 25, \"word_count\": 299, \"sent_count\": 16, \"avg_sentence_length\": 18.6875, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.9, \"difficult_words\": 107, \"verb_count\": 52, \"nnp_count\": 39, \"nn_count\": 65, \"adverb_count\": 6, \"ner_count\": 23, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 25.9, \"gunning_fog\": 14.78, \"smog_index\": 17.2, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 10.38, \"avg_coherence\": 0.447368286550045, \"word_per_second\": 1.916789537790884, \"NPS_score\": 54.66666666666666, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 2, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 2, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 10}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1312, \"CourseName\": \"ESG Disclosure\", \"Transcript\": \"There is increasing awareness of the effect of environmental and social disruptions on business operations, resource availability and product innovation.

Estimates by Bloomberg Economics suggest that global warming could directly cost the world economy $36 trillion by 2050. On the investor side, Larry Fink's voice, as the CEO of the world's largest institutional investor, BlackRock, continues to resonate across both the investment community and corporate America.

ESG integration and stakeholder engagement. In a 2020 Global Institutional Investor Survey, all respondents stated that ESG risks and opportunities played a greater role in their investment decisions in 2019 and 2020. Requirements and expectations for disclosure and reporting. Stakeholders, specifically investors, are assessing ESG performance and making decisions based on publicly available information. Companies are facing increased pressure to provide regular disclosure and indications that they are responding to that reporting expectation. Demands on supply chain transparency and management. The need to identify and address environmental and social risks in a company's supply chain have become of increasing importance to investors and to customers. These stakeholders seek greater transparency and risk management efforts from the businesses they invest in or purchase from. They demand that businesses foster responsible supply chain partnerships, oversight and transparency to ensure compliance with environmental and social laws and other newly emerging regulatory requirements. \", \"Response_Q1\": 8.786666666666667, \"Duration\": 148.89, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/ESG Disclosure/ESGDisc_11_Emerging Trends (continued).srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 25, \"word_count\": 302, \"sent_count\": 17, \"avg_sentence_length\": 17.764705882352942, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 115, \"verb_count\": 46, \"nnp_count\": 18, \"nn_count\": 69, \"adverb_count\": 8, \"ner_count\": 15, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 36.69, \"gunning_fog\": 14.53, \"smog_index\": 15.1, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 11.01, \"avg_coherence\": 0.364109792560339, \"word_per_second\": 2.0283430720666265, \"NPS_score\": 54.66666666666666, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 2, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 2, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 11}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1313, \"CourseName\": \"ESG Disclosure\", \"Transcript\": \"The disclosure methods can be divided into two categories, quantitative and qualitative.

The data must be readily understandable to users of the reports. This means that information must be clearly presented with additional information supplied in the supporting footnotes as needed, to assisting clarification. In contrast, data that is not understandable might only provide a partial picture of ESG performance and may miss important details around the metrics, methodologies and coverage of ESG data. The information must be relevant to the needs of users, which is the case when the information influences their investment, purchasing or engagement decisions. This may involve reporting particularly relevant information or information whose omission or misstatement could influence the decisions of users. In comparison non relevant information may still sway a smaller set of stakeholders, like a marginal customer, for instance, but it will not prove useful in the decision making process for major stakeholders like institutional investors. The information must be free of material error and bias and not misleading. Thus, the information should faithfully represent interconnection with other events and reflect the underlying substance of data. Unreliable information indicates less credibility, representation and evidence driven ESG performance from the reporting company. The information must be comparable to ESG data provided by other players in an industry, so that users can identify trends in the performance and the relative ESG position of the reporting entity. Incomparable data use may result in non common industry metrics and present difficulties in translating data into benchmarkable information for further analysis. Frameworks like GRI and CDP are quantitative disclosure platforms. These frameworks require a company to present figures and quantifiable or measurable performance data on a range of specific indicators.

Vague narratives tend to be misleading and usually lack detail. They require viewers to read between the lines to capture actions and outcomes towards corporate sustainability, and they frequently generate more questions. In contrast, informative disclosures explicitly lay out the time, the stakeholders involved, the motivations, the processes and the results of ESG strategies or programs. Disclosures can also be categorized as being reactive or as being proactive reporting. Reactive reporting tends to satisfy minimal disclosure requirements. The objective is to disclose corporate compliance with regulation and react to various stakeholder pressures on some key ESG issues. On the other side, proactive reporting provides comprehensive disclosures on all issues that could have material impacts to the business. Proactive disclosures include reporting on management approaches, forward looking statements, how ESG fits into the larger business strategic plan, and how ESG is aligned with business value or even with executive compensation. Qualitative disclosure is more subjective and narrative based. It is an explanation of performance delivered to demonstrate progress. Several ESG reporting platforms use qualitative indicators to provide companies with an opportunity to articulate steps taken and outcomes achieved when more quantitative metrics are not an option. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate Related Financial disclosures, both employ quantitative metrics in their standards. SASB, for instance, has the management of chemicals and products, a discussion of processes to maintain compliance with restricted substance regulations.

In the 1980s, chemical companies were the first to publish sustainability reports to help them mitigate issues with their image and concerns over their environmental actions and impacts. These reports did not follow any specific framework and were instead more marketing driven than quantitative or analytical in nature. Between 1980 and the early 2000s, there was a consistent growth in the number of companies publishing annual sustainability or corporate responsibility reports. These reports varied in nature considerably and were totally voluntary. However, shareholders and stakeholders began to expect them. Still, many companies were seen as using sustainability reports as marketing tools to green wash their actual performance. This led to the introduction of auditable frameworks whereby independent third parties reviewed the data for accuracy. The most common became GRI. The first GRI report was published in the early 2000s. Over time, more and more companies would turn to GRI as a means of validating their annual sustainability reports and ensuring that the information was accurate. Over the next 20 years, reporting became more transparent and more frameworks were introduced. In 2020, Black Rock, the world's largest institutional investor published a document titled, Towards A Common Language For Sustainable Investing, in which they expressly called for companies they invest in to use SASB and/or TCFD to report on ESG performance annually. \", \"Response_Q1\": 8.786666666666667, \"Duration\": 106.93, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/ESG Disclosure/ESGDisc_17_The Evolution of Sustainability Reporting.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 25, \"word_count\": 240, \"sent_count\": 13, \"avg_sentence_length\": 18.46153846153846, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 76, \"verb_count\": 40, \"nnp_count\": 17, \"nn_count\": 32, \"adverb_count\": 12, \"ner_count\": 17, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 35.98, \"gunning_fog\": 13.87, \"smog_index\": 14.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.79, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3310167877511544, \"word_per_second\": 2.244458991863836, \"NPS_score\": 54.66666666666666, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 2, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 2, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 17}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1319, \"CourseName\": \"ESG Disclosure\", \"Transcript\": \"The following are some guiding principles to follow when preparing ESG disclosures.

As a user of issuer information, like a research analyst or fund manager, there are some things to look out for. The caliber of information provided can be classified as either greenwashing or as quality disclosures. Greenwashing is relatively common, and it includes unsubstantiated claims on the sustainability of a company's operations and/or their products. This level of reporting or disclosure provides minimal information about real performance or assurances of data quality and actual ESG action. On the other hand, quality disclosure ensures that the data and narratives are supported by evidence or even by third party assurances. For example, companies seek additional verification on their greenhouse gas emissions data from audit or certification firms. Companies could also seek industry common certifications on the ethical and sustainability claims of their products, such as fair trade. High quality disclosure would also provide information related to internal controls and implementation protocols over ESG data and programs. To qualify as high quality disclosures, preparers and researchers of a report should focus on the business case, their quantitative targets, company initiatives, internal risk management strategies and reporting protocols, as well as government structures over ESG reporting.

Comparing company performance allows for the identification of a company's ESG strengths and weaknesses. Following the scorecard exercise in the ESG fundamentals course, you should have some background knowledge around identifying key ESG issues and scoring weights for a company. Once ESG focus areas are determined for your analysis, you should find relevant disclosures from company ESG reports, sustainability filings and public databases. A clear red flag is if you've identified topics you think are materially relevant to a company and you expect to have these issues addressed, but their disclosures do not include any information about those topics. Using quantitative metrics, you can normalize and compare the ESG performance of a company. For example, you might find a total amount of greenhouse gas emissions from a company's sustainability report, you might also find company revenue from public filings. By dividing greenhouse gas emissions by revenue, you would be able to determine greenhouse gas emissions intensity per dollar of revenue for a company. Calculating emissions intensity would allow you to capture resource efficiency and compare company performance based on normalized data with other players in their industry. Another example is water efficiency. You can find the total water withdrawal for each company and divide it by the number of tons of product produced to capture the product water footprint. The baseline units that are used for benchmarking vary across industries. For instance, in the hotels and lodging industry, you can use the number of available rooms and occupancy rates to capture actual rooms that are in use, dividing total water consumption by rooms in use can inform analysts with a hotel's average water efficiency per room. On the social side, you could find the total dollar amount of charitable giving or investment dollars toward local community initiatives, then divide it by company revenue to determine the percentage of corporate engagement dollars. This would allow you to identify whether a company is outperforming or underperforming in terms of allocating resources to support communities. These metrics highlight the importance of credible ESG data and will enhance your assessment of company performance. The demand for eliminating greenwashing from disclosure leads to stringent standards on sustainability claims and accounting. Increasingly, sustainability assurance delivered by credible and objective third parties allows companies, customers and stakeholders to work towards unified standards and substantiated sustainability performance. After the performance is determined and normalized, you can then assign points to the issue based on the criteria you designated in your ESG scorecard. Following the same process for all issue areas, you will be able to complete the ESG scorecard using a metric driven and objective approach. \", \"Response_Q1\": 8.786666666666667, \"Duration\": 204.31, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/ESG Disclosure/ESGDisc_21_Benchmarking Company Performance.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 25, \"word_count\": 473, \"sent_count\": 21, \"avg_sentence_length\": 22.52380952380953, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.8, \"difficult_words\": 134, \"verb_count\": 85, \"nnp_count\": 13, \"nn_count\": 102, \"adverb_count\": 8, \"ner_count\": 6, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 30.8, \"gunning_fog\": 14.74, \"smog_index\": 16.3, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.22, \"avg_coherence\": 0.4134777262806892, \"word_per_second\": 2.315109392589692, \"NPS_score\": 54.66666666666666, \"Program_x\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Core\", \"Level_x\": 2, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"ESG\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Core\", \"Level_y\": 2, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 21}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1323, \"CourseName\": \"ESG Disclosure\", \"Transcript\": \"Among the benefits of completing a quarterly or annual ESG disclosure is a clear understanding of a company's performance on a number of critical performance metrics.

Future risks related to business growth, continuity and supply chain resiliency should be addressed. An evolving ESG landscape can create enormous commercial opportunity for corporations too. Things like more sustainably sourced raw materials, new and lower emission production practices, and lower waste packaging for products not only satisfy the wants of many existing stakeholders by customers and supply chain players, but this type of movement towards a more sustainable global economy may also generate trust among a new or conscientious customer base. And finally, market transparency. With the positive and negative externalities resulting from corporate operations and products now more commonly being disclosed, stakeholders can identify market inefficiency and corporate responsibility for the environment and for society.

Welcome to the RockCrusher Rentals case, part of CFI's Commercial Banking and Credit Analyst training program. This case is a little different from some of our other CBCA cases, in that the focus is on winning a competitive lending transaction away from another financial institution. You've been approached by Tim Smith. Tim serves as lead advisor to Mr. Dave Anderson, the 100% owner of RockCrusher Rentals. Tim is a CPA and FMVA accredited advisor, and he is supporting Mr. Anderson on a five year succession planning initiative that starts with a dividend re capitalization. This is a type of equity take out strategy that uses leverage or borrowed money to draw against the retained earnings position in the company and take it out as a dividend. It's a strategy that is sometimes used for succession and estate planning purposes. Tim has provided you with the following items in the RockCrusher due diligence package, a comprehensive business plan, a working financial model with historical figures and five years of projections, an industry report, review engagement financial statements for the last two fiscal years, an aged accounts receivable listing as at last fiscal year end, and a personal net worth statement for the owner, Mr. Dave Anderson. Your task is to analyze the items in this due diligence package and come up with a creative credit structure that can support the clients request, we'll use that structure and the information in the diligence package to generate an indicative risk rating for RockCrusher rentals. With this risk rating, we'll be able to work through an exercise analyzing risk adjusted return for the perspective structure and try to propose pricing that will win you the deal while still optimizing profitability. While, it's not mandatory, we recommend that you complete CFI's Loan Pricing course, an elective component of the CBCA program, this will help set the foundation around effective pricing strategies, and will build some familiarity with our risk rating tool. Your deliverable at the end of this case study is not a credit application, but rather it's a discussion paper. A discussion paper is a document outlining indicative financing terms, plus a list of additional documents and information that you would need in order to complete a formal credit application. Discussion papers are designed to generate discussion with the client and are not an approval or a commitment of financing. To help with your analysis and presentation, we've included three tools. These are, a blank copy of our comprehensive risk rating model, a collateral calculator, and a blank discussion paper template. If you wish to embark on this case study on your own, please download the material and get started. For a more guided learning experience, we can also work through each step together over the course of the video lessons that follow.

Decide if this client, and this transaction, is something that your institution would be willing to support. Make any adjustments to the personal statement of net worth that you feel are appropriate. We'll work through this together in a video lesson, if you would find that helpful. Next, get more quantitative. Dive into the financials, the aged receivables, and the working three statement financial model. We will review the model together in a video lesson, but I encourage you to spend some time in there to familiarize yourself with it. Maybe play with some of the assumptions and see how they affect the projections. Additionally, review the accounts receivable listing for aging and concentration risk, we have a video lesson for this as well. Assuming that after all this preliminary analysis, you believe there's a deal here, use the collateral calculator tool to break down the most logical way to assign collateral and to structure your lending facilities. We can work through this together in a video module too, but I encourage you to try it out on your own first. Next, you will move forward with the risk rating model, we have provided video lessons for each step. But again, I encourage you to try it out yourself first. We recommend working through the risk rating model in the following order: Business Analysis tab, Management Analysis tab, Industry Analysis tab, Credit Analysis Worksheet tab, Risk Rating Model tab, and finally, the Profitability Model Ray Rock tab. After spending some time in the profitability model, and deciding how you would like to position any pricing exception requests with your manager, you'll need to start preparing the discussion paper for your client. One important component of the discussion paper is the indicative rate and payment amounts, once you've decided on a rate, you'll need to actually calculate monthly payments for all three reducing term facilities. We have a video lesson on how to complete that, but it's a relatively straightforward calculation using The PMT function in Excel. After you have the monthly payment amounts, use the blank discussion paper template we've provided and start filling it in. You may need to reference back to the list of parameters, as well as the notes you've hopefully kept, in order to make sure you have all the correct info, but everything you need to complete the discussion paper has been presented somewhere in this case. Please try and complete it yourself before watching the video debrief lesson. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 152.69299999999998, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_02_Case Study Instructions.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 458, \"sent_count\": 20, \"avg_sentence_length\": 22.9, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.5, \"difficult_words\": 102, \"verb_count\": 71, \"nnp_count\": 27, \"nn_count\": 109, \"adverb_count\": 17, \"ner_count\": 12, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 57.1, \"gunning_fog\": 13.09, \"smog_index\": 13.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.81, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2238889224827289, \"word_per_second\": 2.99948262199315, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 2}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1224, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"Let's go over some key parameters and guidelines that will help us with Credit Structure and Analysis, regardless of what assumptions the client and their advisory team included in the financial model. Consider the following parameters as policies that your financial institution requires you to adhere to for regulatory purposes, these will be included in a separate document for your reference as well. Permitted lending values when setting up your credit structure, good AR described as being under 90 days, 75%. Inventory, 50%. Book value of equipment, 60%. Appraised value of equipment, 70%, and appraised value of real estate 70%. Loan amortizations, four years for cash flow deals, meaning no underlying collateral security. Five years for used equipment, six years for new equipment, and 20 years for real estate. Test interest rates when calculating risk ratings will be 6%, both for operating credit and term financing, with respect to fee structures. Your institution standard pricing on a new loan application is 10 basis points of total proposed exposure, same for future annual review fees. The size of operating line Rock Crusher is looking for would have a $500 per month maintenance or management fee associated with it. Covenants: A transaction of this nature would generally require a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to one. Financial Reporting: At 10 million in borrowing and up, your financial institution requires audited financial statements. Pricing Exceptions: You, as an individual credit analyst, have pricing authority to discount up to 25 basis points from recommended or grid pricing, your VP has up to 100 basis points. Return Expectations: For new clients, your financial institution requires a minimum projected aggregate Risk Adjusted Return On Capital or Ray Rock, of 15%. Personal Recourse: For a competitive deal of this nature and this size, your financial institution is typically comfortable with a 50% covering personal guarantee. Based on anecdotal feedback you've received from Tim, owner, Dave Anderson exhibits the following characteristics: He is extremely rate sensitive, he acknowledges that application and management fees are part of the cost of doing business though, and he is realistic about them, he does not want to pledge personal collateral but has no issue pledging any corporate assets as collateral. Well, it's his preference not to. He understands the non traditional nature of an equity take out and is willing to do a partial personal guarantee in support of the overall lending structure. As you go through the case, make note of items that you feel may be missing or that you think you would need before feeling comfortable going to the adjudication team with a formal credit submission. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 203.33, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_03_Parameters.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 445, \"sent_count\": 23, \"avg_sentence_length\": 19.347826086956523, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.7, \"difficult_words\": 128, \"verb_count\": 70, \"nnp_count\": 31, \"nn_count\": 94, \"adverb_count\": 9, \"ner_count\": 26, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 40.58, \"gunning_fog\": 14.74, \"smog_index\": 15.3, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 9.89, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2903607820293733, \"word_per_second\": 2.188560468204397, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 3}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1225, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"So here we are in the Rock Crusher Rental's projections, the financial model that's been provided by Mr. Anderson's advisory team. Hopefully, you've had a chance to go through and play with some of the numbers. The assumptions are all laid out here very clearly, which is a great best practice. It's quite comprehensive, we have a few years historical and five years forecast, which is great, that allows us to play with some numbers and see how that'll affect cash balances and things of that nature. So, sales growth was addressed in the business plan, you may recall, it's going to continue to grow, but it will be a little bit more muted. They talked, also, about the dividend payout ratio, which aligns here. They talked about their CapEx plans, so the CapEx program going forward, upgrading and adding equipment will be on the order of $4 million per year, and they also talked about how the CapEx would be financed using debt in a decreasing proportion, so they're gonna be taking out a little bit less and less debt. Here in the current year, this debt addition has been highlighted because this includes, not just the $2 million for equipment, which would be their standard addition, but also the $6 million for the dividend re capitalization. The dividend figures here are derived from the payout ratio projections, however, of course, in the current year, that number's significantly higher because $6 million will be going out for the dividend re capitalization, so those have been brought to our attention by being highlighted. A few things in the assumptions here, probably did and should have jumped out, first of all, a gross margin of 96% is extremely unusual and probably inaccurate. So a few factors would likely have gone into this. One, they don't actually purchase inventory, though they have a large inventory position that supports their service and repair division, so that's also a small percentage of their overall business model, but the bulk of their revenue generating assets are not current assets, they're actually fixed assets or long term assets in the form of equipment. So they buy it and it sits as a long term asset on their balance sheet, and they turn around and rent it out, so some of their COGS accounting is unusual. Obviously, there's labor salaries and wages, but this hasn't been assigned as direct labor or that would have appeared in COGS which would reduce our gross margin. So again, this is probably a cost accounting issue and something that you may wanna make note to ask the client and the advisory team about to get more information on this, because that gross margin is extremely high, that would be high even by software standards, but what we wanna focus on more is sort of the net margins and how it affects cash balance. The other things that are extremely unusual would be the inventory and payable days being very, very high. Two factors, again, this is based on, the inventory that they carry is for the purpose of repairs and components of equipment, so it's not a big part of what they do relative to their overall sales, but also because these are calculated on a COGS basis, with COGS being so understated, these numbers are likely overstated, so again, we're gonna make note and request from the client a little bit more information around that. Everything else looks fairly reasonable, so we have a 10 year useful life estimate, which would be matched up with what's in the notes to the financial statements, which means that you're looking at a 10% depreciation rate, so that certainly makes sense. Average long term debt interest projections are 5%, even though that doesn't align with our test rate, we're gonna use a different test rate based on the parameters you've been provided, this is, in fact, a reasonable assumption for the forecast model. So how does this affect profitability in the balance sheet? We can see that even though there's a growing dividend number in dollar terms and expressed as a percentage, a payout ratio, and that more cash on hand will be going into CapEx acquisitions rather than debt additions. We do see a growing cash balance based on these projections, which is excellent from the bank's point of view. And if we go down, we can look at all of these different inputs and assumptions and schedules, and we'll see that going forward, with the exception of this year where they're adding a considerable amount of debt, it looks like the net debt balance is actually going to be decreasing on a going forward basis. So this, again, is a good sign from the bank's perspective too. So highly encourage you to spend some time in this model, play with the numbers, you can also go back to the Industry Report and look at the Industry Average Income Statement and Balance Sheet and compare the actual results and projected results relative to industry norms. That's the beauty of having a spreadsheet and a live model that you can work with. So familiarize yourself with these numbers and we'll move on to our next step. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 312.633, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_04_RockCrush Rentals Projection Model Review.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 901, \"sent_count\": 27, \"avg_sentence_length\": 33.370370370370374, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.4, \"difficult_words\": 140, \"verb_count\": 144, \"nnp_count\": 33, \"nn_count\": 172, \"adverb_count\": 62, \"ner_count\": 26, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 56.73, \"gunning_fog\": 15.0, \"smog_index\": 13.7, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 8.06, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3356819799542427, \"word_per_second\": 2.881973432107295, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 4}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1226, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"So this is Mr. Anderson's personal net worth statement. Hopefully, you've reviewed it. Before we move on to the management analysis and the risk rating, ultimately, it's important to make some adjustments to the net worth statement, or at least to review it to make sure that things haven't been overstated. Now, why do we make adjustments? That's a great question. There are usually three reasons, all of which are present in this example. The first of which is, if a business owner is married, which Mr. Anderson is to his wife, Melissa. In the event of a separation or a divorce, it's safe to assume that half of the assets or certainly half of the net equity would be distributed to the former spouse. So we should make adjustments for that, just in case that were to occur over the course of our lending relationship with this client. The second reason is that some business owners will inadvertently overstate personal assets or add things to the net worth statement that actually aren't personal assets at all, and we'll see an example of that here. The third reason is that not all assets are created equal. So things like a boat or art or collector cars, etcetera, jewelery, they're not nearly as liquid as stocks, bonds, cash, or even real estate for that matter. There's not as big of a market, so we may want to adjust those out to get a better, more true sense of what the liquid, unencumbered net worth is of this business owner. So we can go through here, item by item and make a few adjustments. It looks as though the net worth is stated at approximately $17 million and that's not including Rock Crusher Rentals, the business enterprise itself. So this is a really high number, but as you'll see after some adjustments, that drops down fairly quickly. So example one here is Anderson Holdings, so this is not held personally, this is held by a holding company, and of course, unless we have a corporate guarantee from that holding company, the entire value of stocks in there are basically no good to us in terms of personal assets because they could be encumbered by another bank or any number of different restrictions. Those corporate assets are very protected. So what we're gonna do is actually we're just gonna remove this entire amount. So the next line is a stock, an ETF portfolio, which is held personally. However, we would be wise to remove the spousal interest, so we're just gonna divide it in half. Ditto here under registered investments, so in Schedule B, we have a mutual fund portfolio that's held by Mr. Anderson, and we're going to remove half of this amount as well for spousal interest, and we're gonna do the same thing for real estate. So it looks like the personal residence of the Anderson family is unencumbered at the moment, there is no mortgage on it, and we're just gonna take the stated market value at face value, so we're gonna say it's $2.5 million. However, we're going to divide that by half as well, and we're gonna do the same thing for what appears to be a vacation property in and around Lake Tahoe. This one does have a mortgage, so what we'll do is we'll remove the stated market value, less the balance on the mortgage, so then the net equity on the home, and we're gonna divide that by two. And lastly, we have vehicles and art, as outlined below, both of which are not especially liquid necessarily, and can probably be sold off, hidden or driven away in the event that a lender needed to actually collect on a personal guarantee. So we're just gonna remove these altogether. And what we can do is we can take the stated net worth value here, and simply subtract all of these other items to get what we would call an adjusted net worth figure. So you can see how the originally stated net worth goes from just over 17 million to just over 6 million, which is a very big change, but a much more accurate reflection of actual liquid, unencumbered net worth for the business owner. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 249.53, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_05_Personal Net Worth Statement Adjustment.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 739, \"sent_count\": 33, \"avg_sentence_length\": 22.393939393939394, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.4, \"difficult_words\": 110, \"verb_count\": 112, \"nnp_count\": 27, \"nn_count\": 135, \"adverb_count\": 55, \"ner_count\": 22, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 65.86, \"gunning_fog\": 11.64, \"smog_index\": 12.3, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.18, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2632796761594833, \"word_per_second\": 2.9615677473650464, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 5}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1227, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"Here we have RockCrusher's aged accounts receivable as at their fiscal year end.

In fact, all but $45,000 $46,000 is under 60 days, meaning that it is very current. But before we can get into our risk rating tool, part of the business analysis is understanding the level of potential customer concentration and whether that poses a risk if they were to lose a key account or a number of key accounts. So what we've done is we've actually highlighted the five largest customers as per the accounts receivable listing. Now, that's not a perfect proxy for total percent of sales, but in the absence of any other information, it's the best piece of information that we have, so that we're going to use this tool accordingly.

If we drag this all the way down, we have the total of all the customers listed here. What we need to find out is the top five.

They're not actually gonna be drawing this. It looks like it's a bit of a buffer. So, the big issue here is the dividend recapitalization health flow, the six million dollars. If we look back at our parameters, we know that a cash flow loan with no underlying asset as collateral is required to be on a four year amortization, a four year amortization is gonna have a very stressful impact on liquidity and likely on debt service as well. That's a lot to be paid back in four years, even for a company with margins like Rock Crusher. So we wanna try to get creative by using what collateral is available, and of course, our client has indicated that they're willing to pledge corporate collateral, and then we can try and have a more favorable lending structure when we go into our risk rating tool. So the sources of funds will move across this table, the take out loan is gonna be one reducing facility, and its facility number one that'll align to the facility number one in our risk rating tool. There will be an equipment loan which will cover 50% of the new CapEx plan, the balance will be covered by operating cash flow, the dividend loan, which is going to be loan number two in our risk rating tool, and of course, the credit line. So we see that our total is equal, and that's exactly what we wanna see for a source and use of funds table. Now, let's figure out what our collateral position is, and remember, in our parameters, we were given a series of lending values depending on what the asset was. So, if we were to just take the book value of the equipment, there's a bunch of stuff in there. If you look at note five in the financials, that we probably don't want as collateral, things like computer software, there's a significant amount, there's furniture and office equipment. That's not really favorable collateral from a lender's perspective. However, these three categories do make very favorable collateral. So, if you look at note five, the net book value this year of vehicles is $341,000, unleased equipment is 2.326, and the heavy mining equipment of $13,270,000. And of course, there's the new CapEx. So by the end of this calendar year, there will be an additional four million dollars. So we can also add that in. For a total book value of equipment, close to 20 million dollars, $19,937,000. Now, if we assign that a lending value based on our parameters, we would do 70% of appraised value, which we don't know what the appraised value is, but we do know what the book value is, and we're willing to lend up to 60% of book value. So, working capital assets, we would review our accounts receivable, and we take note that all of the accounts receivable are under 90 days, so classified as good, meaning that the accounts receivable at year end directly from the balance sheet is 1,218,000. We have a lending value on that of 75% as per our parameters, and for inventory, we have a year end position of 2.1 million with a lending value of 50%. So we see there is equipment collateral of close to 12 million available, working capital support of close to 2 million available, and it turns out we also have real estate collateral. So 9487 Industrial Way in Sacramento, where its hold was appraised last year at 6.2 approximately, 6.170, and the Colorado property was close to 3 million, 2.955. Again, we don't have appraisals in hand, however, we can certainly ask for those, and that's something you would consider asking for before moving ahead with a formal credit submission. Lending value on real estate according to our parameters is 70%. So now we know there's a real estate collateral position available of 6.388, so how can we distribute this against these credit facilities for the most optimal borrowing structure? So for equipment, there's 8.875, it's already equipment collateral, so we can assign 8875 of this 12 million dollars. The second loan of 2 million, we can assign an additional 2 million of our equipment, which out of 60% lending value margin, we still have a million dollar collateral surplus. In fact, if we were to position this with our risk management team that we go down to 55% of book value, we would still have sufficient collateral to cover those two term loans, so that's very positive. For the dividend loan, do we have enough real estate to cover it? We have here 6.4 almost, against a six million dollar loan, so we can assign a full six million in collateral against this dividend loan, and we still have a couple hundred thousand dollars in collateral surplus based on the recent appraised values. So that is excellent as well. And for working capital, it would appear that we have close to two million, so we can assign a million dollars of our working capital assets against this, and we can even calculate actually the collateral available less whatever we're assigning. And here you go, there is a collateral surplus of almost a million dollars. So based on the parameters that our financial institution has provided us, 60% of book, 70% of appraised, and 75.50% against working capital assets, it turns out that the entire almost 20 million requests less two rather, so 17.87, can be covered by collateral that's already on the balance sheet are going to be acquired in the next year, the current fiscal year. So we actually go from having a four year amortization to potentially as much as 20 years, based on the fact that we can assign unencumbered real estate against this dividend loan. So we're gonna see how that plays into our ratio shortly. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 436.105, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_07_Collateral Calculations.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 1182, \"sent_count\": 46, \"avg_sentence_length\": 25.695652173913043, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.4, \"difficult_words\": 145, \"verb_count\": 177, \"nnp_count\": 27, \"nn_count\": 251, \"adverb_count\": 58, \"ner_count\": 72, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 58.21, \"gunning_fog\": 10.68, \"smog_index\": 11.9, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.08, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3159694669937545, \"word_per_second\": 2.710356450854725, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 7}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1229, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"We're now into the Risk Rating Model, we're going to work on the Business Analysis Framework tab. So we're going to build a score which will flow through into the risk rating, we've pre populated some notes, but we're gonna actually score it together. So we see a SWAT analysis here, which hopefully you've had a chance to fill in on your own or at least consider some strengths of the business, obviously they have considerable pricing power, which has been demonstrated by very much above average margins. They have a reasonable level of customer diversification, a comprehensive business plan and projections, they haven't lost a client in 19 years, which would indicate they have really strong relationships and a strong cash generating ability. Some weaknesses include that sales are growing, but at a decelerating pace. The client is actively looking to retire and sell the business, that was made clear in the business plan, that raises some questions about his commitment to the company. Does taking $6 million out mean that he's gonna have one foot out the door? That's something we need to try to ascertain. The business is extremely levered to the Mining and Resource sector, that would be considered a weakness. In terms of opportunities, the client is looking to be acquired, so there's a really good chance that we will see a return of our principal and our capital within five years. Which is a great opportunity, considering the collateral position, considering the cash flow ability of this company, that we could see all of these funds return within a couple of years on a relatively clear exit strategy. In terms of opportunities, there's also over 3700 mines in just the two adjacent counties, and thousands more in that part of California, with the satellite office in Colorado, similarly in that part of the country as well. They only have 23 regular customers, so there is opportunity for an operating partner or a buyer to come in and to grow that significantly, so it should be appealing for the right kind of party that's gonna acquire this company. And in terms of threats, significant discounting could steal business or at least erode margins, particularly if one of the suppliers got involved, someone like a Caterpillar, came into that local market aggressively, that is definitely a threat. And a major macro event that affects the Mining and Resources sectors more broadly could also slow business, so if we're comfortable with these strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, we can start assigning a score. And what we have here is a decision rule set and an analysis scorecard, so this is what a level one represents under customer concentration, attitude toward risk planning, etcetera. And this is what a level five represents, five being the best, one being the weakest. We have equal weightings, we're now gonna score against these five criteria. So for customer concentration, we know that they have approximately 46%, so we're gonna indicate here the top five equal approximately 46%, which gives us a score of level three. Attitude towards risk. We can look based on the criteria that are provided here, this is gonna fall somewhere mid range, so we have high leverage temporarily because of the dividend re capitalization strategy, but all around very stable operations. So indeed that would land us probably at a level three as well. Under planning, we have a comprehensive business plan and five year projections, which based on our decision criteria up here would actually give us a level five, so very good. The planning team is... The advisory team has put together a great diligence package for us. CSFs, there's a section in the business plan, so we're gonna indicate CSF section in business plan, these are clearly articulated and in line with industry best practices as per IBISWorld, so this would also score as probably a level five. And succession planning, so we have... The current proposed credit structure is for the purpose of commencing estate planning and succession strategies, so we know that there's a strategy or plan under way. Probably gonna rate that middle of the pack, give that a three in light of we don't have an actual buyer; however, we do have a strategy and a framework in place. So this is likely... And again, this is for indication purposes, not to be submitted directly to risk without additional information, but for indication purposes, this is likely where our business analysis rating will land and flow through into our Risk Rating Model. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 295.45, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_08_ Business Analysis.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 781, \"sent_count\": 31, \"avg_sentence_length\": 25.193548387096776, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.5, \"difficult_words\": 149, \"verb_count\": 124, \"nnp_count\": 24, \"nn_count\": 171, \"adverb_count\": 48, \"ner_count\": 26, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 54.97, \"gunning_fog\": 13.57, \"smog_index\": 13.9, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.99, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2788172307713278, \"word_per_second\": 2.6434252834659, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 8}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1230, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"Moving on to management analysis framework, we're gonna have a look at some of the strengths and the weaknesses of the owner and the management team, and then we're gonna actually score them against the four risk rating criteria that are listed above in our scorecard. So we look at past performance, reputation, planning, experience, stability, attitude towards risk, and then we've made some overall conclusions. Hopefully you've had a chance to go through and populate some information. You can compare it against our observations, but our conclusions were that the equity take out dividend re capitalization strategy is a relatively risky use of funds, particularly given what appears to have been a modest debt strategy, historically speaking, but we have a capable and experienced management team with strong historical results. Mr. Anderson, we feel is surrounded himself with a very good team, which is exhibited by the comprehensive diligence package we received, and the commitment risk that we identified, we believe is likely mitigated by his near term exit strategy. So by maintaining strong margins, they're more likely to be able to optimize valuation. So seeing this through for a few more years is probably the most likely course of action for our business owner, Mr. Anderson. Now, in terms of ratings, industry experience, we have our criteria here again, one being low, five being high, he actually has over 25 years of experience, so that's a level five rating right away. Budget versus actual. We don't have any historical projections; that's not to say we can't get them, in fact, we're probably gonna make note to request that before moving forward with a formal credit application, if that's the direction we choose to go, but for the time being, we're gonna rate that as a one in the absence of that information. So we're unable to compare what they budgeted or projected versus their actual results. Financial reporting history. So this is a new client, we don't actually know. We're gonna have to give that a level three rating. Having said that, based on how organized this package is, in all likelihood, their financial reporting is probably gonna be timely. Also, if you actually look at the financial statements, when they're dated, relative to the year end, they were completed within two months of year end, which is really quite good for a private company of this size. Generally it takes them a little bit longer, and sometimes you'll find yourself chasing your clients for financial statements. Access to capital. We went through the exercise of adjusting net worth, and we know that the adjusted net worth for the business owner is approximately $6.2 million, which equates to 30% to 50% of funded debt. I'll pop that in here, that's a level three.

So these are all taken directly from the income statement, the revenue, the cost of sales, net income plus all the add backs gives us an EBITDA figure, but we're going to test our ratios on an adjusted basis because this company has a dividend payout policy. We're going to adjust the EBITDA by a reduction in the dividend amount, meaning that that's a cash outflow, which is no longer available to service debt. So the adjusted EBITDA figure being used as a proxy for cash flow has removed out the dividend figure. All these other boxes will be populated once we fill our debt schedule.

So what we have here is the current liabilities directly from the balance sheet, less the current portion of long term debt, which will be filled in and calculated automatically using the debt schedule, and we have the equity figure as well, and we filled all three columns.

There's going to be three scenarios in column one, two, and three. Scenario one is going to be the credit request without the dividend recapitalization loan, and that's going to be for illustration purposes so you can see the effect that that nature of loan has on the balance sheet and on the leverage ratios. In column number two, we're going to take the credit request as is, however we're going to treat the dividend recapitalization loan on a four year amortization as a true cash flow facility with no underlying security. And in column three, we're going to treat that $6 million dividend recapitalization loan as a real estate loan, since we are going to propose to the client that they pledge a real estate collateral, which will give us then a 20 year amortization, which is obviously considerably longer. So we can fill these in all at once. So it's gonna actually be a $1 million credit line, that'll be the same for all three columns. We weren't given a projected percent utilization anywhere in the information in the diligence package, however the projections that were put together don't show them going into a line, in fact shows them having a surplus cash balance. So we're gonna be relatively conservative and we're just going to put in 25% projected utilization. Our test rate, which was given to us in our parameter section, is gonna be 6% for operating credit and term loans. So the reducing term facility number one is going to be the take out loan, which is for used equipment. So that's 8,875,000. Our test rate again is 6%. And the amortization on used equipment is five years or 60 months. We're gonna have the same here, 6%, 60 months. In scenario one, we're not going to include our facility number two, which is the dividend recapitalization. We're just gonna do it here, so $6 million, 6% on a 48 month term. Here we're going to use the real estate angle. So test rate of 6%, 12 times 20 years is 240 months. You're gonna see that's gonna have a dramatic effect on liquidity and on debt service coverage. Let's go back to scenario one, they still need a CAPEX loan of $2 million. We're gonna have that in all three. We're gonna test at 6%, and the amortization on new equipment as per our parameters is six years, so 72 months. Now, as mentioned, when you shorten this amortization by such a material amount, you'll see liquidity drops to below one to one on a current ratio, which is not good. We would much prefer to see either the 1.49 or the 1.35. We need to also adjust our equity figures. So this is equity from the balance sheet, only we're gonna subtract this $6 million, 'cause remember this $6 million is going directly out, so it's gonna reduce our retained earnings position. And we're going to do the same here, minus the $6 million. So in both cases, you'll see our fund to debt is low in scenario one, and our equity is high, which gives us really, really excellent fund to debt in leverage ratios. Over here, the inverse is true. They take on the additional 6 million in credit, and what that does is that immediately reduces the equity position by the same amount. So you have a double whammy effect on your leverage ratios, which plays out here exactly as we would expect. They're considerably higher, both total liabilities to tangible net worth and debt to equity, and of course, fund to debt to EBITDA changes as well. Debt service coverage ratio, we have a similar effect. So without that $6 million loan at all, it's very high. With it, on a four year amortization, it's still a very respectable 1.6, because margins and EBITDA are so high for this company. But when you extend that amortization from 48 to 240 months, here you see a big, big jump in our debt service coverage ratio, which again is also more favorable. So next we're going to flow through to the risk rating model component and see how these three different scenarios rate out. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 269.485, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_12_Credit Analysis Debt Inputs.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 751, \"sent_count\": 41, \"avg_sentence_length\": 18.317073170731707, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.4, \"difficult_words\": 97, \"verb_count\": 111, \"nnp_count\": 18, \"nn_count\": 177, \"adverb_count\": 49, \"ner_count\": 44, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 70.23, \"gunning_fog\": 9.34, \"smog_index\": 10.9, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.15, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2913415640210494, \"word_per_second\": 2.786797038796222, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 12}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1234, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"Toggle over now, please, to the risk rating tab in the risk rating model document, the Excel document. If you haven't taken loan pricing, CFI's Loan Pricing course, this is going to be a lot of information and may be confusing, so before we get into the rating component, let's actually look at the measurement portion at the bottom here. We have a risk rating scale that's simplified, the one at your financial institution will look different, but it'll be built similarly, so a very low risk borrower is a level one, a very high risk borrower is a level 6, and that equates to a score range based on a weighted average. What this all means, so the step between, for instance, a low risk and a moderate risk borrower, there'll be a commensurate effect on three key variables that will affect loan pricing and profitability. So in this column is the probability of default, which as that gets higher, the risk adjusted return on a loan goes down in absolute dollar figures. That is also the numerator in the risk adjusted return on capital ratio, which is expressed in percentage terms. And this capital ratio here affects the denominator. So as risk deteriorates, the capital ratio goes up, and profitability, when expressed in percentage terms, goes down as well. Also, the spread that you're required to charge, so this is the recommended pricing or the grid pricing gets higher. So with each step up on this risk scale, in terms of deteriorating risk, the spread that you're required to charge will also go up. Don't worry about that too much, 'cause we're gonna look at the profitability tab in a moment. But if you're interested in this topic, we highly recommend you take CFI's Loan Pricing course. So how does this play out with our ratios? Well, the business management and industry, we did in three separate lessons, and we got a score based on the weightings that were built into that scorecard, and then we've got financial ratios as well. So leverage here, coverage and liquidity here, and then overall flows through to a final risk rating. So looking at Scenario One first, scenario one does not include the dividend re capitalization loan of $6 million, this comes in at a very respectable 71.3, call it, risk rating, which equates to a low risk level two on our rating scale. What happens as we toggle through the scenarios, so scenario two, remember, included the $6 million, but on a four year term. We see the number comes down rather significantly, in fact, because of the way that service coverage and liquidity were scored. So working capital ratio below one to one comes down rather considerably. So we've now gone down a notch on our risk rating scale. Scenario three has the $6 million, but using real estate collateral, so we have a longer amortization. What happens here? The score goes up, but not enough to get us back into a low risk category, so it's gonna remain a level three risk rating on this client. Having said that, and we'll go into the next tab in the next lesson, the nature of the loan also has an incremental effect on its profitability, and because we have real estate collateral, that loan will all of a sudden, be more profitable than an unsecured loan, for instance, or a loan secured by equipment. So even though scenario two and scenario three have the same risk rating and we have the same spread, it does not necessarily equate to the same level of profitability. Next, we're gonna go into the profitability tab in this risk rating model, please. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 223.0, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_13_Risk Rating.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 636, \"sent_count\": 28, \"avg_sentence_length\": 22.714285714285715, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.4, \"difficult_words\": 104, \"verb_count\": 92, \"nnp_count\": 19, \"nn_count\": 169, \"adverb_count\": 39, \"ner_count\": 18, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 65.15, \"gunning_fog\": 11.81, \"smog_index\": 11.9, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.46, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3969535844830366, \"word_per_second\": 2.8520179372197307, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 13}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1235, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"Please toggle to the profitability model RAROC tab in the risk rating model Excel worksheet. This, again, is a little complicated if you haven't taken the loan pricing course, but we'll give you a brief introduction. It's set automatically to Scenario Three, which matches the risk rating column from the credit analysis worksheet, so as you adjust on this tab, the rating and the numbers will flow through automatically to the profitability side. We have loss given default, which is one minus the recovery rate, and as I mentioned earlier, the type of loan can have an incremental effect on the profitability. So in the event of a default with real estate security, you have a lower projected loss than with an unsecured loan, and we'll demonstrate that after. The total funded debt figure here flows directly from the credit analysis worksheets. We know that number is accurate. The general fees, we're using 10 basis points, which is our grid pricing based on the parameters provided to you at the beginning. We don't have any information about expenses, so we'll leave that blank. Capital requirement. We're working off of 10%. You can leave that number as is for illustration purposes. And then in terms of the actual loans themselves, we can go through how this works. So the loan amounts are pulled directly from the credit analysis tab, as is the proportion of total funded debt, so it's calculated as a percentage of here. Fees flow through proportionally as well, with the exception of the operating loan. Again, in our parameters section, we were told there's a $500 a month management fee, so that equates to $6000 a year. That fee based revenue we'll have to factor into our risk adjusted return formula. This is an operating loan, so our loss given default is 75% and that's embedded in this figure, this risk adjusted return figure. The reason it's low, this is below our financial institution's 15% threshold, largely because the projected utilization is low. The lender has to hold capital against this entire amount, even though we're only projecting 25% utilization and interest income as a result, so that's gonna have a downward effect on the projected return. On the other hand, we have three other loans that are going to be above our minimum threshold. So Figure One is supported by equipment finance, it's not unsecured, it's not a commercial mortgage, we have equipment security. So that adjusts our loss given default accordingly and gives us a risk adjusted return at grid pricing, remember our spread is 2.75% above the cost of funds. So at grid pricing, we're looking at a projected risk adjusted return of 23.5, and that's very similar for the equipment finance facility here. The reason they're different is because the amortizations were different. You'll remember this is used equipment, this is new equipment. The amortization has an effect on the amount of interest income. The big difference here on the commercial mortgage loan term facility two, is the loss given default. If we were to examine scenario two, which was an unsecured loan, look what happens to our RAROC. So it goes down really considerably because our formula changes for risk adjusted return, because in the event of a default, you're going to lose considerably more of the principal outstanding than you would if there was real estate security. So we have a nice little buffer built in and these four RAROC figures are calculated proportionally to give us an overall RAROC. So when we read in the parameters earlier that our institution requires a minimum 15% risk adjusted return on capital for a new client, we're currently above that threshold. We also know that the client is really rate sensitive, so using our 25 basis point pricing discretion, let's see what this would look like. So if we go down to 5.5 here, 4.75 here, and on down we go, our RAROC numbers adjust, but we still are north of 20%, which means we still have a further buffer, but it would be outside of your discretion. So depending on how badly you and your manager, your VP, were looking to win this deal, you could tap into their pricing authority, which would give you an additional 75 basis points. So let's start with just 25, so I'll go to five and a quarter. Here we'll go to 4.5. 4.5, we'll drop another 25 basis points. 4.5, where does that leave us? That leaves us at 18.27, so a very modest RAROC buffer built in at this current pricing. So what I recommend is taking a little bit of time to play with this model and try to figure out what you would charge and what would you would recommend charging and how you would position that with your VP when you went to them for a pricing exception. In the next chapter, what we're gonna do is we're gonna cover how to actually fill out a discussion paper and the discussion paper is gonna include an indicative rate. So you have to have a sense of what that rate's going to be based on how profitable we project the loan to be. And embedded within that, of course, is your VP's pricing discretion and their willingness to support you on a discounted client rate that's all in. So take some time to go through this before we move on to the next chapter. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 331.56, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_14_Profitability.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 953, \"sent_count\": 47, \"avg_sentence_length\": 20.27659574468085, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.4, \"difficult_words\": 136, \"verb_count\": 162, \"nnp_count\": 21, \"nn_count\": 209, \"adverb_count\": 48, \"ner_count\": 31, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 61.06, \"gunning_fog\": 10.16, \"smog_index\": 11.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.28, \"avg_coherence\": 0.3103443062553803, \"word_per_second\": 2.874291229340089, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 14}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1236, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"In order to complete the discussion paper, one of the really important components is an indicative payment amount. The client's gonna wanna know what their monthly obligation would be over and above just the interest rate given in your proposal. So what we've done here is we've just taken the three loan amounts from our proposal or from the credit analysis tab. We're working off of a 50 basis point reduction in grid pricing, so pricing exception of 50 basis points. You may have come to a different number, that's fine. We then take that and we divide it by 12 to create a monthly amount, and then the amortization period in months, and we're just going to literally use the payment formula. So rate we have here, it's actually the monthly rate, that's why we calculated it. The number of periods is there, so 60 month amortization. The present value of the loan is the full amount outstanding. The future value is going to be zero, and type, we'll make it end of period for simplicity sake. And there you have a monthly payment on the $8.87 million loan, a price of 4.5% of approximately $165,000 a month. Now, we can actually drag that across and you have all three payment amounts. So if your number is different here on the rate based on your rate calculator and the pricing exception recommendation that you are positioning with your VP, please plug that in and you can change your payment amount accordingly. You're now gonna go and transpose this information into the discussion paper, so have a read through the template that we've provided you, try to fill that in as best you can from beginning to end, before watching the debrief video, where we'll go through the example that CFI has prepared. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 110.56, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_15_Payment Calculation.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 318, \"sent_count\": 18, \"avg_sentence_length\": 17.666666666666668, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.4, \"difficult_words\": 54, \"verb_count\": 56, \"nnp_count\": 6, \"nn_count\": 69, \"adverb_count\": 20, \"ner_count\": 18, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 69.21, \"gunning_fog\": 10.99, \"smog_index\": 11.8, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.86, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2315307873068377, \"word_per_second\": 2.8762662807525325, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 15}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1237, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"Hopefully, you've had a chance to fill in the discussion paper template yourself with your responses and your figures. We'll now take an opportunity to go through our responses and you can compare. Now, what's important to note about a discussion paper, it's exactly what's implied; it's for the purpose of discussing with the prospective borrower your indicative terms, what you believe will be approved. This is different from a term sheet; a term sheet generally is more of a firm commitment from a lender, there's typically been a discussion with the adjudication group, that's not the case here. We need a lot more information which will be included in a subsequent section of this discussion paper, the information that we need, before we'd be comfortable going to our risk management group, but we wanna try to wow this client with prospective rates and structure so that they'll actually pay the application fee and send us the additional documentation. So we've highlighted all of what previously were boxes that you should fill in, so you can see our answers more easily. So it's addressed, obviously, to the business owner, not to the advisor, and the company is Rock Crusher Rentals Incorporated. And so, too, is the borrower in this case. We should have a typo here. Guarantor is going to be by way of personal guarantee, so that's Mr. Dave Anderson, and we'll get into the facility. So facility number one is the operating line of credit, the amount was $1 million, and based on the numbers that we went through in our profitability model, we went with prime or cost of funds plus 2.25%. These facilities are generally drawn in increments of $5000 for a facility that size. Facility number two was our first of the reducing term loan, so this is to pay out the current term financing with the existing lender, the amount as we know is $8,875,599. That's the figure we've been working off of, and it's available at one draw at the time of closing. So legal counsel would facilitate the payout and the perfection of security for that loan. The interest rate, again, is 4.50. So we're going with our full 25 basis point pricing exception plus an additional 25 from our VP, your numbers may be slightly different, and that's fine. The payment amounts that we calculated are here, based on the 4.5%. Again, yours might be different. Amortization, five years, this is for existing used equipment as our collateral, remember. Facility number three is the reducing term loan number two, which is the $6 million dividend re capitalization loan, and it's to support a one time dividend. $6 million, same rate, we calculated our payment here. The payment is considerably smaller, even though it's a large dollar amount, because it's amortized over 20 years. These should match what's on your Credit Analysis Worksheet and the Risk Rating Tool; if it doesn't, then you need to go back and re calculate and make sure that it doesn't affect the actual risk rating and the projected profitability. Facility number four was the $2 million facility, which was in support of the CapEX plan for the current fiscal year. The other half of which was going to be paid with operating cash flow, we've matched rate again at 4.5, and in the last lesson we calculated payment amount of $31,748. For security, this is where our answers may differ slightly, but hopefully are the same; we wouldn't do this deal as a lender without general security agreement, hopefully, you learned that over the course of the CBC, a core program. Our structure would require two collateral mortgages registered specifically over lands and property, the one located in Sacramento and the one located Grand Junction, Colorado. We would require a personal guarantee from Mr. Dave Anderson. Now, this dollar amount, where did that come from? You'll recall, hopefully, from our Parameters tab that on a loan this size, the lender would be satisfied with a 50% full covering guarantee. So this $8.938 million is 50% of $17,875,000. We would require execution of all loan agreements satisfactory to the lender and its legal counsel, naturally, and other security as determined by the lender and/or its legal counsel. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 274.934, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_16_Discussion Paper - Facilities and Security.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 749, \"sent_count\": 34, \"avg_sentence_length\": 22.029411764705884, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.4, \"difficult_words\": 132, \"verb_count\": 120, \"nnp_count\": 39, \"nn_count\": 160, \"adverb_count\": 25, \"ner_count\": 42, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 59.94, \"gunning_fog\": 11.49, \"smog_index\": 12.9, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 7.99, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2477834832388907, \"word_per_second\": 2.7242901932827515, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 16}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1238, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"Now, what other due diligence items might we look for? These are the items that we kept tabs up through the course of this case, you may have a list that includes some, all or even more than what's listed here, but the absolute non negotiables before moving ahead with a formal credit application would be copies of the two real estate appraisals for the sites outlined above, and these would both presumably need a letter of reliance to stipulate that they are for the purpose of financing and addressed to our financial institution, if he decides to move forward with an application at our lending institution. Number two would be copies of clean phase I environmental site assessments for both properties. We would have to ensure there's no areas of potential environmental concerns identified. We would also want audited financial statements for the last two years and additional information around the cost accounting, so the latter portion here is with respect to their gross margin and how they account for COGS. That should hopefully be resolved with a higher caliber of financials and remember in our parameters section, we require audited financial statements for anything north of 10 million in exposure, so it's great to get an indication off of the existing review engagement financials, but before we go ahead with a formal approval, we're gonna want audited financials. We would do a credit check for Mr. Anderson as well, to confirm there wasn't any delinquency or derogatory on their credit bureau. And we would want some additional information also around company safety protocols, as well as regional and state licensing and insurance requirements. It did outline in the business plan that the regulatory environment is changing and it's getting more complicated, so we'd want some assurance that they're up to speed on all of these certifications and qualifications. If possible, we'd want historical results, budget versus actual just because it very well might help our score when we're going through the risk rating tab formally later on for our submission. And the other thing is, we've put an asterix here because we may use this as a negotiating tactic. We may ask for an equipment appraisal just because that would give us even more of a buffer, assuming the appraised amount came in line with the book value or higher, that would give us more of a buffer in terms of collateral value, but working off of 60% book value, we actually have a collateral surplus currently, so this may or may not be required, but you might wanna use that as a negotiating tactic. Financial covenants, this was outlined in our parameter section. A deal of this nature would typically require a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to one. Hopefully, you found that. And reporting requirements, so audited financial statements as stipulated earlier, and we would also want to continue seeing aged accounts receivable to help monitor any kind of concentration risk and aging issues they may come upon in the future. For fees, this was all outlined, both in the parameter section as well as in the RAROC tab of our risk rating model or profitability tab. The application fee would be 10 basis points. The monthly operating line administration management fee is $500, so that's about $6,000 a year, and subsequent annual review fees, we would position with the client as being 10 basis points of total exposure on a going forward basis as well. All security registration and legal fees will be the responsibility of the borrower. You wanna make sure you're stipulating this ahead of going into a formal submission, so there's no confusion on that matter. Hopefully this was helpful. This is a very generic boilerplate template. Your financial institution likely has one that's slightly more comprehensive, but this should give you a really strong indication of what a discussion paper should look like and what kind of information is required to go into that paper. \", \"Response_Q1\": 9.246031746031743, \"Duration\": 236.12, \"ChapterName\": \"SRT files/Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals/RockCrusher_17_Discussion Paper - Other Items.srt\", \"Chapter_count\": 18, \"word_count\": 685, \"sent_count\": 25, \"avg_sentence_length\": 27.4, \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.5, \"difficult_words\": 156, \"verb_count\": 97, \"nnp_count\": 12, \"nn_count\": 145, \"adverb_count\": 41, \"ner_count\": 15, \"flesch_reading_ease\": 45.39, \"gunning_fog\": 14.71, \"smog_index\": 14.6, \"dale_chall_readability_score\": 8.74, \"avg_coherence\": 0.2638508167279803, \"word_per_second\": 2.901067253938676, \"NPS_score\": 72.22222222222223, \"Program_x\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_x\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_x\": 4, \"VideoLenght_x\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_x\": 147.0, \"Program_y\": \"CBCA\", \"Requirement_y\": \"Case Study\", \"Level_y\": 4, \"VideoLenght_y\": \"Under 1 hr\", \"Price_y\": 147.0, \"speed\": \"Speed (words/sec)\", \"coherence\": \"Coherence\", \"readability\": \"Readability\", \"Section\": 17}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 1239, \"CourseName\": \"Case Study - RockCrusher Rentals\", \"Transcript\": \"I hope you enjoyed this case.
